Paradox Development Studio is back with the fourth installment of the award-winning Europa Universalis series. This classic grand strategy game gives you control of a nation through four dramatic centuries. Rule your land and dominate the world with unparalleled freedom, depth and historical accuracy. Write a new history of the world and build an empire for the ages. Start before the Renaissance on a map of the world as it was then. Choose from any of hundreds of nations and then rule up to the Age of Revolutions. Or, if you wish, start your game at any date in the span, with historical monarchs and other leaders. Hundreds of dynamic historical events are yours to experience, from merely troubling civil wars to world changing moments like the Protestant Reformation. Discover and settle the New World, or resist European conquest. Control the flow of trade by developing your trade power in key provinces, using ships and governmental policy to bring the wealth of the world to your own ports. Build alliances into iron bonds, cemented by royal marriage or play a flexible hand, keeping your options open. Strike when your enemies are weak, using your armies to grab new land and new potential riches. Your nation’s pace of development will be heavily influenced by the person on the throne. Experience rapid development under a skilled monarch only to see things slow down when a less competent heir takes over. Plan for the future by spending monarch power wisely. Four hundred years of research into new ways of war, administration and trade are available. Unlock new weapons, new buildings and new ship types. Over time, you can embrace national ideas that represent both your historic legacy and your ambitions for the future. From grand voyages of discovery to religious wars to revolutionary governments, the entire history of the early modern world waits for you to rewrite it in Europa Universalis IV.

The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meager supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls ""the pinnacle of an entire genre"". THE LONG DARK is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. THE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION brings you the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates. Widely considered the paramount Survival game of all time, SURVIVAL EDITION gives you pure focus on THE LONG DARK’s Survival Sandbox -- the experience that started it all! In THE LONG DARK , you are getting both the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates, and the award-winning episodic narrative mode, WINTERMUTE. Included with both THE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION and THE LONG DARK , Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative Survival Sandbox that has defined the genre since launching on Steam in 2014. After years of open development and dozens of major updates, THE LONG DARK now stands at the pinnacle of the entire genre. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. The game that defined death for the survival genre. When you die in Survival, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully. Over 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more. Explore a 50+ square kilometer Northern Canadian wilderness spanning 12 major regions and all the zones that connect them in search of life-saving supplies. Distant mountains, coastal towns, mines, farmlands, and a huge expanse of brutal winter wilderness to test your survival mettle. Hunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates. Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan. Several standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each, such as Whiteout -- the race to gather enough supplies to prepare for a monster blizzard. Or Hunted, where you need to escape a murderous Bear. Complete them to unlock Feats that provide long-term gameplay benefits in Survival Mode. Additional Challenges include: Hopeless Rescue, Nomad, Archivist, As the Dead Sleep, and Escape the Darkwalker. Included in THE LONG DARK The episodic story-mode for THE LONG DARK, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episode Five is in development, and is slated for release at a later date. This will bring the WINTERMUTE storyline to its conclusion. The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. Mackenzie’s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that's taking them to Perseverance Mills? A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie.

Only one will rise above all to win the heart of a nation as the new shogun...The others will die by his sword.

HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named ""Best PC Game Ever"" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide. NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source®, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in: Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial ""muscles,"" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence. Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy. Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story® and Monster's, Inc.®, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game. AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand. Half-Life 2: Episode Two Half-Life® 2: Episode Two is the second in a trilogy of new games created by Valve that extends the award-winning and best-selling Half-Life® adventure. As Dr. Gordon Freeman, you were last seen exiting City 17 with Alyx Vance as the Citadel erupted amidst a storm of unknown proportions. In Episode Two, you must battle and race against Combine forces as you traverse the White Forest to deliver a crucial information packet stolen from the Citadel to an enclave of fellow resistance scientists. Episode Two extends the award-winning Half-Life gameplay with unique weapons, vehicles, and newly-spawned creatures. Half-Life 2: Lost Coast Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2, Lost Coast is a playable technology showcase that introduces High Dynamic Range lighting to the Source engine.

The game introduces new game play elements to realize the thrill and hardships of creating and maintaining a real city whilst expanding on some well-established tropes of the city building experience. You’re only limited by your imagination, so take control and reach for the sky! Multi-tiered and challenging simulation Constructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master. Playing as the mayor of your city you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, fire fighting, healthcare and much more along with your citys real economy system. Citizens within your city react fluidly, with gravitas and with an air of authenticity to a multitude of game play scenarios. Extensive local traffic simulation Colossal Order's extensive experience developing the Cities in Motion series is fully utilized in a fully fleshed out and well-crafted local traffic simulation. Districts and Policies Be more than just an administrator from city hall. Designating parts of your city as a district results in the application of policies which results in you rising to the status of Mayor for your own city. Utilize the Day and Night Cycle The city changes during the hours of the day and affects citizen schedules. Traffic is visibly slower at night and some zoned areas do not work with full efficiency. Cities: Skylines will put you in control of managing the different aspects of the day and night cycles. Extensive modding support Build or improve on existing maps and structures.

Control a variety of warrior ant species in intense battles, command your workers to build and supply an ever-expanding base, and protect your queen at all costs while navigating the unique threats and opportunities of the insect world. Hundreds of warriors clash in a melee of gnashing mandibles as formic acid artillery fires overhead. Nightfall has come and the last of the workers are rushing back underground, dodging beetles to deliver food to the nest. The stockpile is empty, and without more, reinforcements will not hatch for the ongoing war between the duelling Empires of the Undergrowth. Starting from a central room hosting your queen, order your workers to develop and optimise your nest – a vast network of store rooms, nurseries, and hallways. Dig through a hex-based maze of soil and bedrock, seeking food and fending off other underground dwellers. Push beyond the confines of your nest to see what the world above has to offer – with seeds, nectar, fungus, other insects, and even amphibians on the menu, there's plenty to choose from, but each food source comes with its own strategic tradeoffs and challenges. Will you venture forth and fight off the ladybugs that eat and deplete your source of renewable honeydew drops, or do the surrounding nocturnal creatures present too much of a risk for your fledgling colony? Each decision you make has a ripple effect that can doom your colony if you aren’t quick to react to evolving circumstances. Manage a multitude of species with different attack patterns, natural weapons, and evolutionary paths to tackle the particular dangers of your current biome. Nighttime sorties are at times essential as you look to secure food supplies, though unsuspecting ants might fall prey to the dangers that lurk after sundown. Come morning, you’ll find yourself competing with other ant colonies instead, entering enemy nests to attack their queens while defending your own. Prepare to operate and coordinate simultaneous war efforts across multiple underground and overground maps as your threats and opportunities change with each passing moment – there’s no single path to domination. Workers scurry in from the surface. Few have returned, but they carry valuable sources of food that will help reinforce the front as a new wave of warriors pour forth from the nurseries, eagerly following the scent of pheromones that tell them where to go and what to do en route. They are the last bastion of the colony, born with a singular purpose – hold the line! Design and organise multiple nurseries and assign them individual pheromone groups, with each pheromone group taking orders through the placement of pheromone markers, adjustable rules of engagement, and context. Learning to navigate the behaviours of your ants, as well as each species’ strengths and weaknesses, is integral to securing success. Each pheromone group can be specialised on the fly, told to exclusively collect food, partake in combat, or do both – the right decision can turn the tide of battle. In desperate times, when the colony is starving and new eggs have stopped hatching as a result, will your warrior caste focus on gathering food at the risk of being picked off by aggressive enemies en route? Or will the soldiers divide into escort groups for your remaining workers, ensuring survivability at the cost of overall efficiency elsewhere? Don’t forget to keep at least some workers at the nest to dig, build, and maintain the placement of eggs, to ensure the survival of your ant economy. Each species of ant presents its own set of strengths and weaknesses on the battlefield. In special game modes where multiple species can be raised in the same colony, your decision to raise and upgrade one or the other will completely change the way you do battle. Trap-jaw ants fight in melee, occasionally leaping back to replenish lost hitpoints. Leafcutter majors fulfil their natural role as protectors by drawing enemy aggression onto themselves to give allied ants an opportunity to flank, regroup, or escape. Wood ants can evolve to fire formic acid as long range artillery or in a more rapid, straight line. Find synergies between the multitude of natural strengths and weaknesses of each species, and prepare to defend against them when warring with rival colonies. Your enemies are equally varied – apart from other ant colonies, you’ll engage in combat against arachnids, amphibians, crustaceans, and a wide variety of insect species. These powerful and often (comparatively) gigantic creatures present a unique threat to an unprepared colony, and only superior tactics can overcome them. An envelopment manoeuvre can circumvent the adult devil’s coach horse beetle's stunning spray, while tactically isolating and overwhelming hermit crabs one by one will bring their demise faster than they can hunker down to heal. Victory is certain! Reinforcing troops arrive in the nick of time, fearless in the face of the horrifying abomination before them. Today the sadistic scientist has blended hermit crabs with scorpions into a terrifying new threat, but the colony has evolved wisely after experiencing such unnatural foes before. After a protracted battle the fearsome chimaera teeters on the brink of collapse, but a new foe arrives on the battlefield – piercing through the skies above, the hand of some strange being comes down to crush half the reinforcing troops, and from the great beyond the scientist lets forth an evil cackle. The tide has turned once more… Apart from the classic RTS skirmishes against the AI and unique seasonal challenges, Empires of the Undergrowth also features a narrative-driven campaign mode. Follow the simultaneous progress of a lab experiment centred around the mysterious Formica ereptor gene-thief ants alongside a documentary series that explores the various species of ants in their natural biomes. Earn resources through successful documentary missions to upgrade your persistent lab colony and evolve according to your preferred playstyle as you put your ants through a multitude of brutal tests conducted in the name of ‘science’ – but not all is as it first seems… You can play on Linux Games on Linux for FREE!",698,,,"Archive BitTorrent,Item Tile,JPEG,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,TAR,Unknown","Simulation,Strategy,Survival",empires_of_the_undergrowth_1_000016_73927_gog_linux,7.41,"index,nonoindex",7958003521,eng,,software,,129,,,,"2024-06-17T17:36:56Z,2025-03-27T14:31:56Z",2024-06-17T17:36:56Z,,,,,,,"div class=""description"",img src=""//web.archive.org/web/2im_/https://items.gog.com/empires_of_the_undergrowth/headline_01.png"" style=""max-width:596px;"" alt=""headline_01.png"" /,p style=""text-align:center;"",img src=""https://archive.org/download/empires_of_the_undergrowth_1_000016_73927_gog_linux/screenshot-0_Empires_of_the_Undergrowth.webp"" style=""width:620px;"" alt=""screenshot-0_Empires_of_the_Undergrowth.webp"" /,ul class=""bb_ul"",img src=""//web.archive.org/web/2im_/https://items.gog.com/empires_of_the_undergrowth/headline_02.png"" style=""max-width:485px;"" alt=""headline_02.png"" /,img src=""https://archive.org/download/empires_of_the_undergrowth_1_000016_73927_gog_linux/screenshot-1_Empires_of_the_Undergrowth.webp"" style=""width:620px;"" alt=""screenshot-1_Empires_of_the_Undergrowth.webp"" /,div class=""container"",img src=""//web.archive.org/web/2im_/https://items.gog.com/empires_of_the_undergrowth/headline_03.png"" style=""max-width:485px;"" alt=""headline_03.png"" /,img src=""https://archive.org/download/empires_of_the_undergrowth_1_000016_73927_gog_linux/screenshot-2_Empires_of_the_Undergrowth.webp"" style=""width:620px;"" alt=""screenshot-2_Empires_of_the_Undergrowth.webp"" /,strong","Linux Games,GOG Games,GNU/Linux Games,DRM-Free Games,LAYC (Linux Games Y@Ldysse Collection),Uploaded by Y@Ldysse,Empires of the Undergrowth","Empires of the Undergrowth (v1.101071b) [Linux, GOG, v80888]",,,29,2017

The game takes place through a large series of still images that have been rendered in 3D, but it does not include any other animations or dynamic elements. Throughout the game, the player must make choices that will ultimately affect the narrative. Though the gameplay style is completely different, the developer has cited the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Fallout franchises as inspirations for the game. This inspiration is evident in the look of the art used and the narrative of the game. Experience post-apocalyptic Egypt Desert Stalker takes place in post-apocalyptic Egypt, a long time after the apocalypse happened. Humanity has been reduced to smaller settlements clustering together in the wastelands. The player enters this world and will get to see many different regions and characters along the way. Make choices that affect the story Essentially being a visual novel-style game, making choices is the primary way that the player interacts with the game. Most of these choices come in the form of dialogue in choosing what to say to other characters. The choices that the player makes throughout the game will have an impact on how the story unfolds. An interesting story with limited gameplay While the imagery used in Desert Stalker is rendered to a high level of quality, the fact that the game features only static images makes it feel a bit lifeless.

Jump straight into managing your own planets as you guide a civilization through the ages. Become the ultimate empire in The Universim, a new breed of God Game in development by Crytivo. WANNA BE A GOD? Your time is coming. Guide a fledgling civilization through the obstacles of life. From humble beginnings, watch as they evolve and advance throughout the ages under your wing. Influence their decisions and punish the unfaithful with a wide range of godly abilities. Interact with objects, create disasters, and launch clueless creatures into orbit. This is your world, and nothing can stop you from having fun. Our goal is to bring back the features you know and love from classic god games and spice them up with fresh ideas, a modern physics engine, and stylized visuals developed by a few of our very own industry heroes. THE STORY OF A SPECIES Meet the Nuggets, a fragile and whacky species that relies on your leadership to build, research, and advance. Help them, and they will soon begin writing their own history in the stars. Every Nugget is a unique individual with a distinct set of characteristics. Just like any other living creature, Nuggets must have access to a few vital resources in order to survive. This includes water to drink, food to eat, and recreational activities to increase their happiness and quality of life. Recreational activities may include blowing stuff up. You’ve been warned. As you spend time with the Nuggets, You will see that they behave like natural, living beings. They have their own thoughts and needs - and they even have the ability to make their own decisions at times. We want to give you a feeling that you’re interacting with a living organism, almost like you’re messing around with a rather chaotic ant farm. ORGANIC GAMEPLAY Planets in The Universim aren’t just made up of a bunch of neatly-arranged objects; everything is linked together and plays a unique role in each planet’s ecosystem. Every tree your civilization cuts down, every resource they mine and every animal they hunt will affect the world they’re living in. A lack of trees and high levels of pollution will raise the global temperature over time, while reckless hunting or fishing might cause the extinction of some species. It’s your mission to manage how the Nuggets collect and utilize resources. What mark will you leave on the ecosystems that existed millions of years before your arrival? Will you use every available resource and expand at an unprecedented pace, or will you methodically create a more sustainable way of life for your civilization? These are living, breathing worlds where everything is interconnected. We aim to provide you with an unique experience unlike any of the god games you have played before. Every decision you or your civilization makes will have consequences. NATURE AS YOU KNOW IT In The Universim, nature is just as wonderful and unpredictable as ever. Every planet comes with a few surprises that are sure to challenge your civilization. From tornadoes that consume everything in their path, to thunderous earthquakes that threaten to split your civilization in two. If you treat nature poorly, it might just show you how brutal and unforgiving it can be. Each planet you encounter will have a unique underbelly. Some planets are tranquil and filled to the brim with resources, while others are barren and dangerous. Be careful out there! Something as simple as the cycle between night and day can play an important role. Wild animal attacks are more common at night, as are frequent temperature drops. Daytime offers a little more safety from the harshness of the world. With the inclusion of a full, four-season cycle, a planet’s biomes can change drastically, making it extremely difficult for Nuggets to survive brutal winters without proper preparation ahead of time.

Note: Crusader Kings 3 is known for its startup problems, but on the modern Manjaro 25.0.0 Zetar (XFCE Edition) and Linux Mint 22.1 (Cinnamon Edition) it plays well. The performance of this game was tested on these distributions. There may be problems with others. Your legacy awaits. Choose your noble house and lead your dynasty to greatness in a Middle Ages epic that spans generations. War is but one of many tools to establish your reign, as real strategy requires expert diplomatic skill, mastery of your realm, and true cunning . Crusader Kings III continues the popular series made by Paradox Development Studio, featuring the widely acclaimed marriage of immersive grand strategy and deep, dramatic medieval roleplaying. Take command of your house and expand your dynasty through a meticulously researched Middle Ages. Begin in 867 or 1066 and claim lands, titles, and vassals to secure a realm worthy of your royal blood. Your death is only a footnote as your lineage continues with new playable heirs, either planned… or not. Discover a sprawling simulated world teeming with peasants and knights, courtiers, spies, knaves and jesters, and secret love affairs. An extensive cast of historical characters can be romanced, betrayed, executed, or subtly influenced. Explore a vast medieval map stretching from the snowswept Nordic lands to the Horn of Africa, and the British Isles in the west to the exotic riches of Burma in the east. Claim, conquer, and rule thousands of unique counties, duchies, kingdoms, and empires. Each character is larger than life, with traits and lifestyle choices determining their actions and schemes. Prompt fear and dread as you rule with an iron fist, or inspire your subjects with magnanimous deeds. Genetics can be passed along to your children, be it the gift of genius or crippling stupidity. Groom your heir with the appropriate guardians or educate them yourself. If found wanting, marry them off or despatch them through other means. Customize your ruler and noble house, from appearance to attributes, and create a monarch worthy of all their inherited virtues and vices. Govern an ever-evolving realm and grant titles to whom you see fit - or usurp your liege to claim their crown as your own. Be wary of rivals, from restless serfs to revengeful concubines. The shadows stir frequently, and danger lurks around every darkened corner. Recruit agents and other unsavory elements to undermine, blackmail, or murder those who stand in your path. Or be inspired by the bard and ballad, and seduce your way to power and influence. Blood will flow. Assemble men-at-arms units and powerful knights. Manage your battlefield tactics and armies. Raid and plunder nearby lands or hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major conflicts. Be a pious king to invite the religious powers to your side, or design your own faith as you battle between everlasting fame or eternal damnation. Bring novel innovations to your culture and construct mighty castles and bastions to increase the wealth, prestige, and security of your realm.

(When Seagulls Cry) Welcome back to the Rokkenjima of October 4, 1986. You have once again been given a chance to catch a glimpse of the family conference held annually by the Ushiromiya family. The remaining life in the old family head who has built up a vast fortune is very slim. To his children, the greatest point of contention at this family conference is the distribution of his inheritance. Everyone desires all that money, no one relents, and no one believes. Who will gain the old head's vast inheritance? Where is the 10 tons of gold that the old head is said to have hidden? Can the unnerving riddle of the epitaph which is said to point to the location of that gold be solved? In the midst of this, a suspicious letter is sent from one claiming to be a witch. The presence of a 19th person on this island, which should only have 18, begins to hang in the air. Brutal murders repeat, and unsolvable riddles are left at the scene. How many will die? How many will live? Or will everyone die? Is the culprit one of the 18, or not? Is the culprit a ""human"", or a ""witch""? Please, enjoy this isolated island, western mansion, mystery-suspense gadget of the good old days to the fullest. Troubleshooting 1.

Battle Challenging Bosses Test your combat decks against powerful foes with unique mechanics and attacks. Build a Team - or Buy One! Hire mercenaries, find pets, or impose upon your friends to accomplish your goals. Master Hundreds of Cards Each character has unique negotiation and combat decks to draft from.

From the decade of big hair, excess and pastel suits comes a story of one man's rise to the top of the criminal pile. Vice City, a huge urban sprawl ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz to the ghetto, was one of the most varied, complete and alive digital cities ever created. Combining open-world gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with delights and degradation and given the opportunity to take it over as you choose. Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himsel Troubleshooting 1. Blackscreen on startup Do not use long path/directory name.

It’s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’. Banter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory. Return to Point & Click Swashbuckling Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze. Embark on Archipelago Adventures Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces.

Consider a donation here: donate Take to the streets for intense close quarters combat, where a team's survival depends upon securing crucial strongholds and destroying enemy supply in this multiplayer and cooperative Source Engine based experience. The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives. Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features. Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes. Squad system built upon role-based player classes, which are customizable and asymmetrical based on what team you are on. Squad-based communication system which includes 3D VOIP, allowing friendly and enemy players within proximity to hear you. Overhead map detailing objective and teammate locations. Accumulate supply to customize and upgrade your gear, affecting your weight, stamina, and movement speed. Simplified HUD and UI for a clean, immersive user experience focused on the action and environments. Highly immersive particle FX and audio to intensify the game experience. Create custom maps and content using the Insurgency SDK and scripting system, and share them on the Steam Workshop. Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or ""tug of war"". Ambush --- A high value target (""HVT"") must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.

Strange creatures preying on livestock. Houses infested with vengeful spirits. The sleepy town of Scarlet Hollow has suddenly come alive with horrors, just in time for your arrival.   This was supposed to be a quiet getaway in the rural mountains of North Carolina. All you had to do was finally meet your long-lost cousin and comfort her through her mother’s funeral. But now, each new day welcomes new nightmares. You only have to survive a week. But you may not make it to the end in one piece. Scarlet Hollow is an immersive horror-mystery with sharp writing, impactful choices, and meticulously hand-drawn art from award-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard. It's being released across  7 episodes . The first FOUR are available now for you to play, with the remaining episodes to follow as free updates as we finish them. Features A heavily branching narrative where your decisions (actually) matter . The relationships you forge and the decisions you make will dramatically alter your journey. Terrifying  and  funny.  Charming characters and snappy dialogue flip to pulse-pounding dread and horror at a moment's notice. Trait-based dialogue and role-playing.  Scarlet Hollow's dialogue system is driven by role-playing elements that let you choose who you want to be. Are you quiet and observant? Hot and clueless?  Can you talk to animals ? 21 different character builds change how you interact with the world and how your story unfolds. A dynamic relationship system that reacts to your every choice and changes how your story unfolds.  People won't just like or dislike you. Become friendly rivals, bitter adversaries, best friends, or mild acquaintances with everyone in town based on how you approach the story. No jumpscares.  All of the horror in Scarlet Hollow comes from building tension and dread (and some disturbing imagery). Original monster designs inspired by Appalachian myths and cryptids.  You won't find any predictable vampires or zombies here. Touching romance.  Whether you're into goths, dads, paranormal investigators, mysterious recluses, lo-fi beats to study and water your plants to, or  actual monsters , we've got all your bases covered. Hundreds of meticulously hand-drawn and traditionally inked backgrounds.  Every background in the game is drawn by hand and inked on massive 19x24 inch paper. Countless immersive sprites.  Each major character has dozens—and often hundreds—of hand-drawn sprites that interact with backgrounds and capture a full range of lighting, emotion, environment, and outfit changes. Scarlet Hollow is a horror game, and it is not intended for all audiences. Please visit our website (https://www.blacktabbygames.com/content-warnings) if you need a full list of content warnings.

The player takes the role of a vagrus - a caravan leader who strives to survive in a strange and dangerous dark fantasy world by leading a traveling company on all kinds of ventures. A vast realm is yours to explore, filled with unique locations, strange factions, and a colorful cast of characters. In order to punish the Empire for its sins, the Elder Gods unleashed their power a thousand years ago that ended up devastating the realms. The continent is now a wasteland, riddled with arcane anomalies, swarming with twisted monsters, and haunted by roaming undead even after long centuries of rebuilding. A large selection of stories make up the game’s narrative in the form of events and quests. The choices you make in these often affect your companions and the world around you. Pick your background from trader, mercenary, or explorer; work for factions, follow rumors and trading opportunities; acquire wealth, gain fame, and discover hidden knowledge. Engage in turn-based, tactical combat that involves your companions and a large variety of enemies, both humanoid and monstrous. Use a wide range of character skills as well as your own leadership-related abilities to succeed. Positioning and support skills are of paramount importance in these challenging engagements. Journeys have to be planned and prepared for carefully, lest they end in disaster. Manage your supplies, morale, and your crew’s vigor effectively to survive. Haul cargo and valuables across the wasteland or take it from others. Your crew of workers, fighters, scouts, and slaves have to be managed well to optimize their effectiveness. A wide variety of companions can work for you in versatile caravan roles, such as scoutmaster, guard captain, treasure hunter, or beast handler. Each companion comes with unique combat skills, background stories, and personal quest lines that can upgrade them further when you complete them. Ally yourself with mighty factions that shape the Riven Realms with their influence on commerce, brutal wars, and constant scheming. From prosperous Trading Houses to criminal syndicates and religious organizations, these groups offer powerful rewards and boons to those loyal to their cause. But take heed - befriending a faction will more than likely antagonize others.

Things that were removed from TSX-11.MIT.EDU and Sunsite.UNC.EDU include copyrighted material as found on Disk 5 in info.for.cdrom.vendors, files duplicated between the archieves, and GNU software that is part of the GNU archieves. As with previous editions we have included the complete GNU archive from prep.ai.mit.edu so as to be in full compliance with the GNU Public License, a copy of which is provided in the ""gnu"" directory. Starting with this release we no longer include the ports for processors other than the Intel x86.  If demand for ports for other hardware becomes sufficient, we will make them available on a separate CD-ROM.  Lets us know! The following are mirrored directly from their home sites:     Red Hat     Debian     Slackware     XFree86     Kernel Sources (from nic.funet.fi)     Networking Code (from ftp.linux.org.uk)     Flagship     GNU sources     JE, JF & JG     and (naturally) sunsite and TSX. Other packages have been provided to us by their authors. See the RoadMap at the end of this file for the layout of the 6 CDs. These discs are mastered in ISO-9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions to preserve the long mixed case filenames and deeply nested directory structure.  Translation tables are provided in each directory to help find things under MS-DOS or other systems that do not support the Rock Ridge extensions.  A directory in the root of each CD called ""rr_moved"" contains files too deeply nested to be accessable under the ISO-9660 format.  These files will appear in their correct locations (and the directory ""rr_moved"" will be empty) on systems which support Rock Ridge.  The ""TRANS.TBL"" file shows the original long mixed-case UNIX(tm) filename and the ISO-9660 alias. The only parts of TSX we provide are the ALPHA, BETA, and packages/GCC directories.  The majority of the other files are duplicated at Sunsite. If there are any particular packages you feel are missing, please let us know and we will include them on future releases. Some popular packages have been removed due to copyright restrictions, these include: Mosaic, Netscape, kermit, getty_ps, xv, and Chimera.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  These (and more) can of course be found on our FTP server, ftp.infomagic.com (165.113.211.2) in /pub/mirrors/linux/.  The list of restricted packages continues to grow, we have followed the guidelines in the file ""info.for.cdrom.vendors"" found on disc 5. The following files are included with the permission of their authors: SCSI HowTo    (Drew Eckhardt) ncftp        (Mike Gleason) Included distributions and their versions are shown below. Debian GNU/Linux    1.2.10 RedHat            4.1 Slackware        3.2 SLACKWARE 3.2 Notes: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Due to changes in the Slackware setup, the distribution now appears directly off the root of Disc 2.  The installation sets are in the directory ""slakware"" to match the expectations of the setup utility. The boot and root images are in bootdsks.144/bootdsks.12 and rootdsks respectively directly off the root of the Slackware CD. The boot images are now supplied uncompressed and the root images are used in their compressed form - If creating the root floppies manually DO NOT UNCOMPRESS THE IMAGE FILES ! Red Hat v4.1 Notes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ We have tried to provided as much of the Red Hat Contrib directory as possible.  However, at 1GIG including source, we were forced to removed some things.  Notably, copyrighted material, source code, and a few programs were were unclear as to the copyright. Overall, the Contrib Diretory has been broken in to 3 parts: RHSCont1 on DISK 1, RHSCont2 (files lettered from a-p) on DISK 4, and RHSCont2 (files lettered from q-z) on DISK 5. Notes for NewComers ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The RedHat distribution is now included in the CD set and may be easier to install than Slackware.  Please refer to the file ""README"" in the root directory of Disc 1 for instructions on installing this distribution. For help with installing Slackware, refer to the files in the ""docs"" directory of Disc 2.

Not one, not two, but three Rufuses cause all kinds of crazy mayhem in the long-awaited adventure comedy Goodbye Deponia: The Organon plans the destruction of Deponia, the lovely Goal has (once again) disappeared, and anti-hero Rufus just can't seem to stop getting in his own way. All inventor and free spirit Rufus wanted to do was to get off the junkyard planet of Deponia and move to Elysium, the paradise orbiting Deponia as a spaceship reserved for the highest echelons of society. Goal, the ex-Elysian girl that Rufus has fallen head over heels for, still seems to be the key to his endeavor...and to the elevator that will get him to space. Finally, Rufus has come up with a seemingly perfect plan. And yet, everything that could possibly go wrong suddenly does go wrong. Rufus finds himself (initially in disguise) on a highway cruiser amongst stern-faced officials of the Organon, while Goal goes missing. When Rufus stumbles upon a cloning machine, he believes to have found his way out. A clone copy is supposed to help him out of his predicament. But an ""inexplicable"" error causes complications and Goal slips from our hero's reach once again. Now, he has to solve three major problems: He needs to find Goal again, reach Elysium and prevent the destruction of the entire planet of Deponia by the hand of the Organon. Three problems that only three Rufuses could solve – and thus, the luckless inventor decides to clone himself! This leads to crazy ramifications for the player: In Goodbye Deponia, the player occasionally needs to control all three Rufuses, using them to complete tasks together – despite Rufus stumbling over himself so often. Goodbye Deponia is the epic conclusion to the Deponia trilogy and sequel to the best German game of 2013 (German Computer Game Awards). The award-winning Deponia series comprises of three wacky tales of adventure from the junkyard planet Deponia. These classic point & click romps not only delight comedy fans and adventure veterans, but also newcomers to the genre. The humorous Deponia series impresses with beautiful, hand-drawn 2D comic graphics, sarcastic dialogues and plenty of black humor. It has received numerous press awards, among them the German Computer Game Award (Deutscher Computerspielpreis) and many other German developer awards. A classic point & click adventure in a unique world, in the tradition of Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett and Matt Groening. From the makers of Memoria, Edna & Harvey: The Breakout, A New Beginning and Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes. An epic conclusion to the iconic Deponia series. Unique comic style with hand-drawn HD 2D graphics. Cutscenes set to music with lovingly realized animations. You can play on Linux!

General Information about the Linux Developer's Resource ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ These discs are published every 3-4 months (or so) and include snapshots of the TSX-11.MIT.EDU and Sunsite.UNC.EDU linux archives. As with previous editions we have included the complete GNU archive from prep.ai.mit.edu so as to be in full compliance with the GNU Public License, a copy of which is provided in the ""gnu"" directory. The following are mirrored directly from their home sites:     Red Hat     Debian     Slackware     wine     XFree86     Kernel Sources (from nic.funet.fi)     Networking Code (from ftp.linux.org.uk)     Flagship     GNU sources     JE & JF     and (naturally) sunsite and TSX. Other packages have been provided to us by their authors. At H. J. Lu's specific request the ""private"" subdirectory of the ""GCC"" distribution is not included on the CD's. At the request of the Debian group we have not included the preliminary version 1.0 distribution which is expected to be replaced by a 1.1 release just as this CD-set ships. Marc Ewing of Red Hat Software granted us explicit permission to include their port for the DEC Alpha.  We have included a stripped down version of this release, even with 6 CD's something has to go !  In particular we have not included the entire source tree for the Alpha version, only the kernel sources and some few other packages.  Marc also tells us that a new version of the Alpha port is expected shortly.  The complete source RPMS are included for the 3.0.3 Intel version. See the RoadMap at the end of this file for the layout of the 6 CDs. These discs are mastered in ISO-9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions to preserve the long mixed case filenames and deeply nested directory structure.  Translation tables are provided in each directory to help find things under MS-DOS or other systems that do not support the Rock Ridge extensions.  A directory in the root of each CD called ""rr_moved"" contains files too deeply nested to be accessable under the ISO-9660 format.  These files will appear in their correct locations (and the directory ""rr_moved"" will be empty) on systems which support Rock Ridge.  The ""TRANS.TBL"" file shows the original long mixed-case UNIX(tm) filename and the ISO-9660 alias. A few large packages common to TSX-11 & SuNSITE have been merged and put into top level directories.  This includes the kernel distributions and XFree86. Some popular packages have been removed due to copyright restrictions, these include: Mosaic, Netscape, kermit, getty_ps, xv, and Chimera.  We applogize for the inconvenience.  These (and more) can of course be found on our FTP server, ftp.infomagic.com (165.113.211.2).  The list of restricted packages continues to grow, we have followed the guidelines in the file ""info.for.cdrom.vendors"" found on disc 2. The following files are included with the permission of their authors: SCSI HowTo    (Drew Eckhardt) ncftp        (Mike Gleason) The Linux How To documents can be found below the ""docs"" directory on disc 1.  They are provided in a number of formats.  The HowTo material is also provided in the form of a Microsoft Multimedia Viewer title (along with the Viewer software) for browsing/searching under Microsoft Windows.  The Viewer supports both hypertext access to all the HowTo's and full-text search.  You may search for single words or phrases and find all occurrences in any of the documents.  It will present a list of topics in which your search phrase was found as well as highlighting the text in each topic. We have provided a setup program for the Viewer software and HowTo docs, select ""File/Run"" from the program manager and run X:\viewer\setup.exe (where X is your CD-ROM drive letter).  The viewer may also be run directly from the CD.  From the Program Manager of Windows, select ""File/Run"" and type in the following command:     X:\viewer\mviewer2 HowTo.MVB where ""X"" is the letter corresponding to your CD-ROM. Included distributions and their versions are shown below. Debian        0.93R6 RedHat        3.0.3 for Intel 2.1 for Alpha Slackware    3.0 In the directory ""lininst"" on Disc 1, is a Microsoft Windows based installation utility that will assist you in selecting the correct boot kernel based on your hardware.  It will create the boot & root diskettes for Slackware within Windows.  It also detects your CD drives and floppy drives.  It may be run directly from the CD, or copied to the hard disk.  If for some reason it does not correctly detect your CD, you may invoke it with the drive letter on the command line to override the automatic CD detection. SLACKWARE 3.0 Notes: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Due to changes in the Slackware setup, the distribution now appears directly off the root of Disc 1.  The installation sets are in the directory ""slakware"" to match the expectations of the setup utility. The directory ""slaktest"" is used for CD dependant installs as explained in the Slackware setup screens. The Boot & Root disks are in the directory ""slackwar"" to make them easier to find under DOS (where long file names are not allowed :-). Please refer to the installation notes in the ""slackwar"" directory before proceeding.  Contributed software is in the directory ""slackwar/contrib"" on disc 1. The complete source tree is in ""slackwar/source"" also on Disc 1. This tree contains a set of scripts to build either the entire tree of any part of it.  These scripts are called SlackBuild. The boot images are now supplied uncompressed and the root images are used in their compressed form - If creating the root floppies manually DO NOT UNCOMPRESS THE IMAGE FILES ! Notes for NewComers ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In the ""doc\howto"" subdirectory of disc 1, there are a series of HOWTO documents that provide detailed instructions on how to configure and install nearly every aspect of Linux.  Please refer to these before starting if you have never done it before !  These documents are in UNIX(tm) format which means they do not end in CRLF, only LF and will therefore not print on most DOS systems.  You will need to view them with an editor or word processor (or use the included Multimedia Viewer software). For help with installing Slackware, refer to the files in the ""slackwar"" directory of Disc 1. The tools used to create the bootable floppies, for all the distributions, are in the directory ""utils"" on disc 1.  This directory also contains a number of partition manipulation utilities including one called ""fips"" that can be used to resize DOS partitions without damaging them.  Please read the file ""fips.doc"" in the directory ""utils\FIPS"" on disc 1 before using it.

What a Legend!  is an adult point-and-click adventure game with both sandbox and visual novel elements set in a medieval fantasy world. The Story The story is about a young man that goes to the biggest city in the realm to lose his virginity but ends up meeting a mysterious woman who sends him on an epic quest; a quest full of sexual encounters, unhappy housewives, beautiful damsels, comely magical creatures, and the chance to become a legend.  Gameplay In What a Legend! you explore the world, interact with characters, and complete their stories. Importantly, there are no wrong decisions in WaL. You experience the game by choosing whose quest line to complete. The quests often involve solving problems that different characters have and improving your standing with them to unlock sexual content. Being designed as a sandbox means that, eventually, you’ll be able to focus on whichever character you like (or several of them simultaneously). If you need help with any of the storylines, go to your tent, open the treasure chest and check the crystal ball for hints. Most female characters in the game are (or will be) conquerable. To reach each character’s sexual content, you’ll need to complete their respective storylines. The game contains  NO NTR  content (with a small exception in the prologue).

Two Point Museum Includes: Design, manage and develop incredible museums 5 unique main museum locations to Two Point County: - Prehistory - Memento Mile - Aquarium - Passwater Cove - Supernatural - Wailon Lodge - Science - Bungle Wasteland - Space - Pebberley Heights 3 Pop up museums with set tasks and challenges Sandbox mode to build your very own MEGA MUSEUMS! 6 main exhibit types and 30+ sub categories of exhibits You’ll adventure through 5 different expedition maps with 100+ unique points of interest 200+ unique exhibits to uncover and fill your sticker book 350+ decorative items to make your museum uniquely you 18 guest types to meet and cater for …. including those meddling kids Unlock and manage all the museums in Two Point County! As fledgling curators, you have the task of designing and refining your very own museums to create the ultimate guest experience. Coordinate Experts on far-flung expeditions to discover new Exhibits, generating Buzz to entice droves of knowledge-hungry guests who will expect top info-tainment if they’re to leave impressed. This is all while you keep your Exhibits safe, rooms clean, staff happy… and children off the dinosaur bones. As Curator, the design and management of your expanding museum is in your hands! Send your team of partially trained Experts on Expeditions in search of rare and mostly well-preserved artefacts. When (and hopefully not if) your Experts return from their adventure, proudly display their fantastic finds in your museum. You’ll unlock new locations as you decide where the next adventure takes you. Your work doesn’t end there; Exhibit maintenance is crucial. While some Experts are gallivanting across Two Point County and beyond, you’re in charge of managing staff back home to ensure Exhibits and the museum stay in tip-top condition. If taking care of the carnivorous Chomper isn’t enough, there are also meddling thieves to watch out for. Thieves, and more frequently, children, are known for touching and grubbing up the displays, so make sure enough security is guarding your prized collection! Get creative to design your museum layout your way! You have decorative freedom, so design thematic areas to guide your guests’ visit. Splash paint and lay carpet as you lovingly arrange each prehistoric fern, potentially melting iceman, and dinosaur remains wherever you see fit. Once you’ve created the perfect atmosphere, arrange guided tours with custom routes led by a charismatic Expert. Tours are a fantastic way to enrich your guests' experience. To keep guests enthused, showcase Exhibits with the highest Buzz - those that are top quality, provide ample info and beautiful decorations are likely to attract the most donations! Guests know best! The different types of guests who will frequent your museum may have different interests, but they do have some things in common… they expect the place to be kept clean, have plenty of refreshments, ample toilets, and a gift shop filled with goodies. And, of course, they need to be dazzled with knowledge of your Exhibits, which are kept well-maintained… Two Point County will bring a variety of guests to your museum, and they all hope to discover their new favourite Exhibit… From dino fanatics and botany buffs to haunted horror seekers, you’ll need to cater to their personal preferences to meet their needs. By exceeding their expectations, you can keep them engaged, leading to longer visits, increased donations, and glowing reviews!

Old World is a historical strategy game where you lead your empire through multiple generations, building a grand legacy to last beyond your own years. This is an era of great leaders, from the revered to the feared. Which will you be? Marry for politics, raise your heirs, and manage your relationship with the families of your kingdom. In the fast and furious world of kings and queens, family matters. Each of the 7 kingdoms has four noble families that provide various benefits when put in charge of your cities. Manage family ties through events, actions, and marriages to keep them happy and reap additional benefits. Upset them, or make them too powerful, and you risk their ire. Maintain a strong family unit, or distract yourself with more illicit adventures. The world is full of great characters with distinct personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. Use them to forge your kingdom, defend your borders, and build ties with other leaders. Seek out and recruit famed warriors, philosophers, builders, and more. Have them tutor your children, lead your armies, and further your reign. Different personality archetypes allow your court members to perform different tasks in similar roles. Find the right combinations to take full advantage of governors, diplomats, spymasters, and even your spouse. Characters develop new personalities and traits over time, growing old, gaining experience, and finally falling ill and passing away, leaving room for the next generation. Unsettled tribes, barbarian marauders, and remnants of previous cultures are all waiting in the vast unexplored wilderness. Discover artifacts and great heroes of the past at ruins scattered across the map. Experience over 3,000 unique events inspired by history and mythology. Contact with foreign dignitaries triggers event chains, stories, and courtroom drama. Pursue ambitions and legacies related to conquest, development, faith, and more. Historically inspired scenarios, weekly challenge games, and a choice between randomly generated and handcrafted maps to explore. Lead Carthage to victory as Hannibal in the Punic Wars, hold your own against Barbarian Hordes, or compete against other players in tackling fictional scenarios. Why do things the way they've always been done? Old World brings a new take to key elements of the 4X strategy genre: Go beyond the traditional resources. Buildings are made of wood and stone, not ""industry."" Population doesn't grow off ""food"" alone. Orders are a resource shared across your realm. Instead of moving every unit once per turn, each unit can be moved multiple times until fatigued or Orders are depleted. Technological advancement is not predetermined. Randomization helps keep technology trees feeling fresh with each new playthrough. Quality of life improvements, such as the ability to undo mistaken commands and nested tooltips, ensure you're always making informed decisions. Play with friends in countless multiplayer modes - from hotseat, to asynchronous, to cloud play. Mods further open up infinite options for new worlds, empires, and dynasties - inspired by our real world, and by works of fiction as well.

He's grown prudent, amicable, kind and caring, without any intention to cause major mayhem just to further his own selfish ends. It seems he is far from chaining himself to flaming saw blades, training torpedo-dolphins or plundering platypus nests. Or is he? Eventually, it's a flaming saw blade that “persuades” Goal to stay on Deponia once more, splitting her personality into three parts in the process, each aspect of her consciousness stored to a different cartridge.So it's up to Rufus and his remarkable charm to persuade Goal's personalities to fuse into one again, make his way to Elysium with her and save Deponia from certain Chaos while he's at it. Join Rufus on his way through the vast area of the Floating Black Market, meet new, bizarre characters and reunite with familiar faces. The second adventure on Deponia tells a unique, self contained story playable without further knowledge of the first installment. Challenging puzzles, elaborate dialogues and unique wacky humor ensure a truly hilarious gaming experience. Fans of the first game will discover new aspects of familiar characters' backgrounds and have many questions answered. Strange and wacky devices ranging from torpedo dolphins, burning saw blades, and even anti-gravity socks. Challenging puzzles coupled with hours of dialogue bristling with humor.

Children of Morta is an action RPG with a rogue-lite approach to character development, where you don’t play a single character - but a whole, extraordinary family of heroes. Hack’n’slash through hordes of enemies in procedurally generated dungeons, caves and lands and lead the family of Bergsons, with all their flaws and virtues, against the forthcoming Corruption. FEATURES: GAMEPLAY Gameplay-wise it's a unique mix of action-adventure RPG, rogue-lite and hack and slash game. By leveling up, you develop not only individual characters but also the entire family. There is no permadeath and you can change family members between the dungeon runs. STORY The story takes place in a distant land but copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it's about a family of heroes standing against the encroaching darkness. DUNGEON CRAWLING All the dungeons in the game are procedurally generated, which means their layout is different with each adventure. There can be from two to four levels of each dungeon, with a unique boss fight at the end. You can always get back to the previous dungeons to get extra XP or finish all the side quests. CHARACTERS & SKILLS Ranged attacks, magic spells, blocks, stuns, healing, evasions and passive skills - it's all there for you to discover, unlock and upgrade. You can choose from seven different family members, each one having unique skill sets. The father, John - a protective warrior with a sword and shield. The elder daughter Linda - a precise archer. Kevin, a quiet fighter equipped with deadly daggers. Lucy - a lively and bold fire mage. Mark - a mindful martial arts fighter. Joey - who smashes his enemies with a sledgehammer. And the latest addition to the family - Apan, a mighty healer and a firm defender in one. ART STYLE A combination of hand painted pixel art and frame-by-frame animations partnered with modern lighting techniques come to life to create the beautifully dangerous world of Children of Morta! CO-OP LOCAL CO-OP is already available in the game, so two players can become the Bergsons and fight the Corruption together. ONLINE CO-OP is still in development and will be released in a future update.

See Troubleshooting. The 58th year of Shouwa, early summer It’s June, and the summer heat has arrived earlier than it does most years. By day there are crickets, and by night there are cicadas. We’re in Hinamizawa, a small village in the countryside. There are fewer than two thousand people here. But every year, there is an event. This event is a mysterious death. (The series has run from 1979 to 1983) On a certain day in June, someone dies, and someone else goes missing. The series of deaths is connected to the upheaval surrounding the dam construction project. A murder case that was covered up is being reenacted. Is it a conspiracy? A coincidence? Or perhaps a curse? Someone who was supposed to be there isn’t. Someone who wasn’t supposed to be there is. Someone who was alive last night is dead now. And someone who is here right now isn’t alive. So, there is no way to avert tragedy. There is no choice but to give up. But don’t give up. Only you can stand up to this.

It is here that Jerry’s dream of being a magician comes true, though a haunting, sinister force casts a long shadow over the forest. Someone offers the residents of Mousewood a deal of their lifetime - tickets to the greatest magic show that the world has ever seen. But the price is steep, as they'll have to bet their houses, their money… and their lives. As the shadows grow deeper, the residents of Mousewood have only Jerry to turn to. On an adventure full of laughter and tears, joy and fear, the young boy will face the ultimate trial, leaving behind the world he once knew, and his childhood, too, will become a thing of the past. It’s a story-driven exploration/adventure from Matthias Kempke, who believes that game design is all about creating new worlds to be explored by players. Multi-layered story that starts out light-hearted and funny, but which shifts to a dramatic and thought-provoking tone over the 20 hours of gameplay. The animal people who populate the game were originally developed in short stories written by game creator; these stories are included as the in-game bonuses.

However, all stories must come to an end. This War of Mine has been giving you a thrilling experience of living through the war as a civilian for five years since its release. Numerous updates and expansions have broadened the experience and filled it with more shades and tonalities of hard civilian existence during wartime. Now, honoring the 5th anniversary of the original release, 11 bit studios proudly presents to you This War of Mine: Final Cut. This War of Mine: Final Cut contains all the updates and free expansions released so far and introduces not only a new scenario but also expands all scenarios with the locations known from Stories DLCs - even if you don’t own those. In short words - that means you can now experience lots of never-seen-before playthroughs and struggle with new challenges. Major changes and new content: One new classic scenario All locations from TWoM Stories added to the original game New quests and Events on Stories locations Remastered versions of all the classic locations A brand-new character Minor changes and tweaks: 64bit and 32bit version 21:9 aspect ratio support 4k UI adjustments new main menu additional smaller bugfixes and tweaks About This War Of Mine: In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better. This War of Mine - main features: Inspired by real-life events Control your survivors and manage your shelter Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme You can play on Linux Games on Linux for FREE!",1003,,,"7z,Archive BitTorrent,Item Tile,JPEG,JPEG Thumb,Metadata","Action,Adventure,Survival",this-war-of-mine-dlc-bonus-v-6.0.8-linux-gog-v-34693,2.72,"index,nonoindex",2918634466,eng,,software,,74,,,,"2024-03-25T19:38:45Z,2024-03-26T05:31:34Z",2024-03-25T19:38:45Z,,,,,,,"div class=""title__additional-options"",img src=""//web.archive.org/web/2im_/https://items.gog.com/this_war_of_mine/TWOM_FinalCut_SpecialSection_Header.jpg"" alt=""TWOM_FinalCut_SpecialSection_Header.jpg"" /,strong","Linux Games,GOG Games,GNU/Linux Games,DRM-Free Games,LAYC (Linux Games Y@Ldysse Collection),Uploaded by Y@Ldysse,This War of Mine","This War of Mine + DLC Bonus (v6.0.8) [Linux, GOG, v34693]",,,18,2014

Features: RogueVania : The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath. 2D Souls-lite Action : Tough but fair combat, more than fifty weapons and spells with unique gameplay, and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble. Nonlinear progression : Sewers, Ossuary or Remparts? Once unlocked, special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, your play style or just your mood. Exploration : Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes. Take a moment to stroll the towers and breath in that fresh sea mist infused air... Interconnected levels and progressive unlocking of access to the island provides you with a real incentive to explore your surroundings. Add in a degree of evolution for your character and permanent weapon upgrades and you can see where Dead Cells borrows from the long line of MetroidVanias that precede it. At the end of the day though, it’s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly getting better, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park.

Moreover, there are those among the citizens of Andergast who swear that the crows are bringing them dark nightmares.

The year is 1989. You are a man named Henry who has retreated from his messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched high atop a mountain, it’s your job to look for smoke and keep the wilderness safe. An especially hot, dry summer has everyone on edge. Your supervisor Delilah is available to you at all times over a small, handheld radio—your only contact with the world you've left behind. But when something strange draws you out of your lookout tower and into the forest, you’ll explore a wild and unknown environment, facing questions and making choices that can build or destroy the only meaningful relationship you have. A Note: Firewatch is a video game about adults having adult conversations about adult things. If you plan on playing with a younger gamer, that might be good to know going in. A stunningly beautiful wilderness environment that expands as you explore. A tailor-made story: the choices you make shape the narrative and build relationships. An edge-of-your-seat mystery. Secrets and discoveries to be made over every hill.

Like the best tabletop roleplaying experiences, Wildermyth gives you choices and answers your every decision with consequences that drive your characters forward. Lead a band of heroes as they grow from reluctant farmers into unique, legendary fighters. Combat unexpected threats and strange monsters across interactive battlefields. Unravel mysteries and share pensive moments in an ever-new fantasy setting that blends hard truths and sacrifice with humor and personal storytelling. Where does your myth lead? Come help us uncover it! Reminiscent of tabletop roleplaying, unique heroes are born in unique settings every game. They age, transform, fall in love, disagree, and make harrowing sacrifices. Each hero brings their own organic history and personality with them, but your choices and combat skills are what decide their paths and outcomes. All heroes die someday… but you get to hold on to your favorites. Reintroduce them in the next adventure, and over many lifetimes the myths you make will form your own legendary pantheon. An Imaginative Papercraft World The Yondering Lands, where the game is set, is a richly layered world populated with hand-painted 2D characters and scenery. We’ve paid loving attention to breaking molds and exploring new ideas: no orcs, elves, or goblins here—but watch out for the telepathic insect-dragons and the clockwork undead. Extreme Character Depth Each of your heroes has their own unique generated history, personality, and appearance, and will form relationships with your other heroes. All of these elements change and develop over the course of a playthrough, as characters age, encounter mysteries, and overcome challenges. Choices That Matter Your hero may choose to trust the enigmatic wolf god, leading to a hair-raising change in their appearance and combat abilities. Or they may pursue a romance with a fellow hero, giving each of them a shared buff and more story opportunities. Encounters and events have permanent, character-defining effects, letting you craft the arc of each character. A New Approach to Death Did your favorite character get one-shotted by a tentacled horror-bear? Choose to let a hero ""fall back"" with a maiming that will lead to some transformative new paths in their legend, or let them go out in a blaze of glory to be remembered for generations to come. Deep and Creative Tactical Combat Combat in Wildermyth emphasizes teamwork and careful positioning, as well as imaginative use of your evolving capabilities and surroundings. Walling and Flanking mechanics provide clear but conflicting incentives, while mystical interfusion lets you remake the battlefield with explosive magic. Multiple difficulty levels mean you can get as intense as you want to. Cooperative Multiplayer In a multiplayer game, you and your friends can each customize and control your own heroes as you play through a campaign. Recommended for up to five players—though in a typical campaign, you start with three heroes and pick up the fourth and fifth along the way. We also support Steam Remote Play. Endless Replayability Pick and choose from a huge bank of combat abilities as your heroes level up in each playthrough, and decide whether you prefer offensive or defensive tactics, brute strength, stealth, or magically flinging fire from a nearby lamp into your enemies' faces. Procedural generation gives you new heroes, new enemies, new story events, and new maps every time you play. A Custom Pantheon of Legends You’ll have the freedom to customize hero appearances, names, histories, and more. As time passes, heroes grow old and may retire, or else might fall in combat—and yes, some will survive all the way to the end.

RedHat Mother's Day + 0.1 release Kernel sources up to version 1.2.13 and 1.3.15 XFree86 3.1.1 integrated into Slackware.  XFree86 3.1.2 is also included A fully functional demo of Pathfinder (usable until the end of September).  This is a visual source code browser for C/C++, Tcl and iTcl.  It also includes the ""Open Desktop Graphical Frontend"" for relational databases. A demo of dBMAN from Versasoft.  dBMAN is a comprehensive relational database managment program.  It includes tools for: Information Management, Program Development and Report Printing. UNIX Cockpit, an X11 filemanager. A demo of SmartWare PLUS from ANGOSS Software.  SmartWare PLUS is a cross-platform integrated product suite that includes: Relational Database, Spreadsheet w/Presentation Graphics, WordProcessor, and Communications.  Keys to enable the demo for personal or commercial use are available from InfoMagic. The GPM (Garden Point Modula) Modula-2 and Oberon compilers for Linux. The WordPerfect SCO demo which runs with the Linux iBSC package. A demo of FlagShip, an application generator for Linux, like Clipper under DOS.  This was made available by Mark Bolzern. A demo of ""zbbs"" from Maple Leaf Software. GPPLINUX, a demo of an Object Oriented development environment for Linux. The /usr tree of a Slackware 2.3.0 installation which may used to run most packages from the CD.  This is an option in the Slackware setup. The full Slackware 2.3.0 source tree. The ""mini-linux"" distribution that allows a Linux ""Test Drive"" from an existing DOS partition. General Information about the Linux Developer's Resource ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ These discs are published every two months (or so) and include snapshots of the TSX-11.MIT.EDU and Sunsite.UNC.EDU linux archives. As with previous editions we have included the complete GNU archive from prep.ai.mit.edu so as to be in full compliance with the GNU Public License, a copy of which is provided in the ""gnu"" directory. The following are mirrored directly from their home sites:     Slackware     wine     Kernel Sources     sunacm (Networking Code)     Flagship     GNU sources     JE & JF     and (naturally) sunsite and TSX. Other packages have been provided to us by their authors. See the RoadMap at the end of this file for the layout of the 4-CDs. These discs are mastered in ISO-9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions to preserve the long mixed case filenames and deeply nested directory structure. A few large packages common to TSX-11 & SuNSITE have been merged and put into top level directories.  This includes the kernel distributions and XFree86. Some popular packages have been removed due to copyright restrictions, these include: Mosaic, Netscape, kermit, getty_ps, xv, and Chimera.  We apologize for the inconvenience. The following files are included with the permission of their authors: SCSI HowTo    (Drew Eckhardt) ncftp        (Mike Gleason) The HowTo docs have been pulled out and put into a directory directly off the root of disc 1.  The HowTo material is also provided in the form of a Microsoft Multimedia Viewer title (along with the Viewer software) for browsing/searching under Microsoft Windows.  The Viewer supports both hypertext access to all the HowTo's and full-text search.  You may search for single words or phrases and find all occurrences in any of the documents.  It will present a list of topics in which your search phrase was found as well as highlighting the text in each topic. We have provided a setup program for the Viewer software and HowTo docs, select ""File/Run"" from the program manager and run X:\viewer\setup.exe (where X is your CD-ROM drive letter).  The viewer may also be run directly from the CD.  From the Program Manager of Windows, select ""File/Run"" and type in the following command:     X:\viewer\mviewer2 HowTo.MVB where ""X"" is the letter corresponding to your CD-ROM. Included distributions and their versions are shown below. RedHat        Mother's Day + 0.1 Slackware    2.3.0 JE        Latest version from September In the directory ""lininst"" on Disc 1, is a Microsoft Windows based installation utility that will assist you in selecting the correct boot kernel based on your hardware.  It will create the boot & root diskettes for Slackware within Windows.  It also detects your CD drives and floppy drives.  It may be run directly from the CD, or copied to the hard disk.  If for some reason it does not correctly detect your CD, you may invoke it with the drive letter on the command line to override the automatic CD detection. SLACKWARE 2.3.0 Notes: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Due to changes in the Slackware setup, the distribution now appears directly off the root of Disc 1.  The installation sets are in the directory ""slakware"" to match the expectations of the setup utility. The directories ""slaktest"" and ""link2cd"" are used for CD dependant installs as explained in the Slackware setup screens. The Boot & Root disks are in the directory ""slakinst"" to make them easier to find under DOS (where long file names are not allowed :-). Please refer to the installation notes in the ""slakware"" directory before proceeding.  Contributed software is in the directory ""slakinst/contrib"" on disc 1. The complete source tree is in ""Slackware_Source"" also on Disc 1. This tree contains a set of scripts to build either the entire tree of any part of it.  These scripts are called SlackBuild. Notes for NewComers ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In the ""howto"" subdirectory of disc 1, there are a series of HOWTO documents that provide detailed instructions on how to configure and install nearly every aspect of Linux.  Please refer to these before starting if you have never done it before ! The RedHat distribution is now included in the CD set and may be easier to install than Slackware.  Please refer to the file ""redhat.rme"" in the root directory of Disc 1 for instructions on installing this distribution. For help with installing Slackware, refer to the files in the ""slakinst"" directory of Disc 1. The tools used to create the bootable floppies, for all the distributions, are in the directory ""dos_util"" on disc 1.  This directory also contains a number of partition manipulation utilities including one called ""fips"" that can be used to resize DOS partitions without damaging them.  Please read the file ""fips.doc"" in the directory ""dos_util\FIPS"" on disc 1 before using it. The ""boot"" and ""root"" images have been uncompressed, so you may ignore the mention of ""gzip"" in the install notes.

XFree86 3.1 integrated into Slackware.  XFree86 2.1 and XFree86 2.1.1 are also included. DOOM for Linux.  InfoMagic provided Linux CD's to ID Software to assist in the port and this is the reward !  You will find it in disc2/sunsite/games/x11/action/doom.  Additional files are in disc2/sunsite/Incoming. A demo of FlagShip, a dBase compiler for Linux, like Clipper under DOS.  This was made available by Mark Bolzern. A demo of ""zbbs"" from Maple Leaf Software. A demo of Executor, a MAC emulator for Linux. A demo of ""UNIX Cockpit"" for Linux. A live image of a full Slackware 2.0.1 installation that may be used to run directly from the CD via symbolic links. General Information about the Linux Developer's Resource ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ These discs are published every two months (or so) and include snapshots of the TSX-11.MIT.EDU and Sunsite.UNC.EDU linux archives. As with previous editions we have included the complete GNU archive from prep.ai.mit.edu so as to be in full compliance with the GNU Public License, a copy of which is provided in the ""gnu"" directory. The following are mirrored directly from their home sites:     Slackware     wine     Kernel Sources     sunacm (Networking Code)     bogus distribution     Flagship     GNU sources     JE & JF     and (naturally) sunsite and TSX. See the RoadMap at the end of this file for the layout of the 3-CDs. These discs are mastered in ISO-9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions to preserve the long mixed case filenames and deeply nested directory structure.  Every directory includes a file ""YMTRANS.TBL"" which lists the ISO-9660 compliant alias and the original filename.  The sources in the YM_UTILS directory can be used to either copy or create symbolic links on systems that do not support the Rock Ridge extensions. A few large packages common to TSX-11 & SuNSITE have been merged and put into top level directories.  This includes the kernel distributions and XFree86. Some popular packages have been removed due to copyright restrictions, these include: Mosaic, Netscape, kermit, getty_ps, ncftp, xv, and Chimera.  We apologize for the inconvenience. The HowTo docs have been pulled out and put into a directory directly off the root of disc 1.  The HowTo material is also provided in the form of a Microsoft Multimedia Viewer title (along with the Viewer software) for browsing/searching under Microsoft Windows.  The Viewer supports both hypertext access to all the HowTo's and full-text search.  You may search for single words or phrases and find all occurrences in any of the documents.  It will present a list of topics in which your search phrase was found as well as highlighting the text in each topic. We have provided a setup program for the Viewer software and HowTo docs, select ""File/Run"" from the program manager and run X:\viewer\setup.exe (where X is your CD-ROM drive letter).  The viewer may also be run directly from the CD.  From the Program Manager of Windows, select ""File/Run"" and type in the following command:     X:\viewer\mviewer2 HowTo.MVB where ""X"" is the letter corresponding to your CD-ROM. Most of the distributions can be found off the root of disc 1 in the directory ""distributions"".  Included distributions and their versions are shown below. Slackware    2.1.0 SLS        1.0.6 TAMU        1.0-D JE        Latest version from September MCC        1.0+ Debian        0.91 Beta (on disc 3) bogus        1.0.1 In the directory ""lininst"" on Disc 1, is a Microsoft Windows based installation utility that will assist you in selecting the correct boot kernel based on your hardware.  It will create the boot & root diskettes for Slackware within Windows.  It also detects your CD drives and floppy drives.  It may be run directly from the CD, or copied to the hard disk.  If for some reason it does not correctly detect your CD, you may invoke it with the drive letter on the command line to override the automatic CD detection. SLACKWARE 2.1.0 Notes: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Slackware is found below the ""distributions"" directory.  The installation sets are in the directory ""slackware"" to match the InfoMagic menu option in the CD-ROM installation.  The Boot & Root disks are in the directory ""slakinst"" to make them easier to find under DOS (where long file names are not allowed :-).  Please refer to the installation notes in the ""slakware"" directory before proceeding.  Contributed software is in the directory ""distributions/slackware/contrib"" on disc 1.  Refer to the RoadMap below for the disc location of these directories. Notes for NewComers ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In the ""howto"" subdirectory of disc 1, there are a series of HOWTO documents that provide detailed instructions on how to configure and install nearly every aspect of Linux.  Please refer to these before starting if you have never done it before ! The easiest distribution to use seems to be Slackware.  Please refer to the material in the ""distributions/slakinst"" directory on disc 1 for help in getting started. The tools used to create the bootable floppies, for all the distributions, are in the directory ""dos_util"" on disc 1.  This directory also contains a number of partition manipulation utilities including one called ""fips"" that can be used to resize DOS partitions without damaging them.  Please read the file ""fips09.doc"" before using it. The ""boot"" and ""root"" images have been uncompressed, so you may ignore the mention of ""gzip"" in the install notes. RAWRITE, and various other DOS utilities are provided in the ""dos_util"" directory off the root of disc 1. Note:  The directory names shown above are DOS format.  The actual file name which will show up in Linux is ""distributions/slakinst/...""

It is the year 1881. For the last few months, the trains belonging to the famous railroad company, Twinnings & Co have been the target of a whole series of hold-ups and ambushes. The management of the company has decided enough is enough and they have to put an end to the raids. It has offered a reward of $15,000 for anyone who captures the leader of the gang responsible. But no one in and around El Paso has the courage to take on the might of the bandidos, so the outlaws just keep on robbing train after train. Even the local Marshal is keeping well out of it. It’s only when a stranger rides into town that things start to change. Bounty hunter John Cooper pays a visit to the local Twinnings & Co manager offering to end the railroad company’s problems once and for all. He gathers together a gang of his old partners and declares war on the bandidos. But during his pursuit, which will take him through half of the southwestern United States, Cooper soon discovers that on this mission nothing is quite what it seems...

Ill-tempered and entirely too convinced of his own greatness, he lives at the edge of a small settlement somewhere in the most remote sector of the garbage-covered planet Deponia. He dreams of a better life in the floating cities of wealth and beauty high above the planet surface. When the angelic Goal falls from these privileged spheres down into a neighboring trash heap, Rufus sees his chance. He decides to bring the unconscious beauty back to her home. Only a vague hope of making it off Deponia at first, he soon formulates an unscrupulous plan, as he learns that he is a dead ringer for Goal’s upper-class husband. The planned handover is only the beginning of a wild chase across Deponia full of twists, turns and mystifying mix-ups. Deponia is a fast-paced comedy of errors and one of the most unusual love stories in gaming history. The twist-filled story takes its off-beat characters all over trash planet Deponia, a unique game world in the style of Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett and Matt Groening. From Kuvaq, an improvised village built inside a giant trash heap, to the swimming black market and the dark corners of the elevated planetary railways: The new adventure game from the makers of The Whispered World, Edna & Harvey: The Breakout and A New Beginning is brought to life with detailed hand-painted backgrounds in widescreen format and top-quality cartoon animation. Unique comic style with hand-drawn HD resolution 2D graphics. Bizarre characters and wacky humor. Challenging puzzles and hours of dialogue. Unique universe in the tradition of Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett and Matt Groening.

Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene have peculiar jobs: They give people another chance to live their lives, all the way from the very beginning. But this isn't their story. Probably. Instead, it's about Quincy . Let me tell you a story about him. One day, Quincy was invited to a fancy parteh at a suspiciously secluded mansion. So, he accepted and went; because even though the mansion was suspicious and secluded, it was also fancy and had a parteh. In fact, it turned out to be so fancy that there was a time machine in its bathroom. Quincy could wash his hands and time-travel while he was at it. Talk about a time-saver! But of course, then people start dying, because that's what they do. And somewhere along the way, things get a little Lovecraftian and tentacles are involved. Anyway, that's around 1/3 of what the game is really about. Key Features A story that will make you curse at the screen A cozy mix between adventure game elements and classic RPG aesthetics Dialogues that read so wrong but feel so right An espresso execution with zero filler and no time drains long cat F.A.Q.: Q: Is playing To the Moon & Finding Paradise necessary before playing this game? A: Impostor Factory can be played independently, just like the games before it. Q: Is Impostor Factory the sequel to To the Moon & Finding Paradise ? A: Maybe not. Maybe it's a sequel. Maybe it's a prequel. Maybe it's both. But again, there is no prerequisite to playing Impostor Factory.

When three NYU students kill themselves one after the other, nobody thinks that a sinister force is at work.  Nobody but fledgling medium Rosa Blackwell and her new spirit guide Joey Mallone.  It's trial by fire as they set these troubled spirits to rest. Blackwell Unbound The year is 1973. The sound of a lone, ethereal saxophone drifts over the Roosevelt Island promenade, while a series of accidents plague a midtown construction site. The citizens of Manhattan take no notice of these events, let alone think they are connected. Embittered medium Lauren Blackwell and her spirit guide Joey Mallone are the only ones who believe that there is anything strange going on, and they are the only ones who can stop an enigmatic killer from striking again... Blackwell Deception Street psychics. Their blinking neon signs are everywhere, promising love and wealth and happiness. They make a fortune preying on the gullible and milking them dry. So when these victims begin dying and leaving confused spirits behind, it can only take a genuine psychic (and her wayward spirit guide) to clean up the mess. From seedy downtown nightclubs to penthouse apartments to a luxury yacht on the Hudson River, Rosa and Joey will unearth the truth about the underground world of street psychics. Including some secrets that Joey would rather be left buried. The Blackwell Convergence A new film opens to rave reviews, despite its bloody history. A beautiful uptown office remains unoccupied, despite its prime location. A downtown artist berates himself for selling out, while a Wall Street investor congratulates himself on a job well done. Just normal life in the big city? Or is somthing more sinister binding these events together Bizarre connections are a dime a dozen for the Blackwell family, but just how far back to they go?  Medium Rosa Blackwell and her spirit guide Joey Mallone are about to find out. The Blackwell Epiphany A dead man’s soul cries out against the force of a ferocious blizzard. He cries for help. He cries for answers. Then he screams as he is torn apart like damp tissue paper. This wasn’t the first time, and it won’t be the last. The police are powerless to stop it, so the duty falls to the only ones who can. What force could be so powerful – and so malevolent – that it would destroy the very core of a life in order to get what it wants? Rosa Blackwell and Joey Mallone mean to find out, even if it means risking themselves in the process.

It’s about a group of five friends -- little tree creatures who set out on a journey to save the last seed from their home tree, which is infested by evil parasites. The gameplay is about exploration, solving little funny puzzles, meeting strange tree creatures, and paying attention to the music as it provides you with useful clues and hints. The whole game takes place on one huge and strange tree that is inhabited by bizarre and freaky creatures. This is not an ordinary game. It is far from it. Everything about it is curiously unique and very surreal, and that alone makes it worth checking out. It's just not possible to be bored in this game, as every new location brings something new and intriguing. The exploration elements are made with incredible polish and attention to detail, and the same applies to the musical score, sound effects, and, most importantly, the visuals. The synergy of those elements create a beautiful and memorable adventure that is enthralling beyond measure. Visually stunning and emotionally touching game that is as unique and bizarre as it is fun. Highly interactive environment that encourages experimentation and exploration.

Both Trine Enchanted Edition as well as the original Trine are included in the Enchanted Edition. The different versions are selectable from the game launcher. All Trine purchases have been automatically updated to Trine Enchanted Edition. Trine is a physics-based action game where three characters combine their powers to devise clever solutions to challenges created by hazardous puzzles and threatening enemies. The gameplay is based on fully interactive physics where each character's different abilities and tactics can be used to invent new ways to overcome obstacles and save the kingdom! The single-player game is fantastic fun, but Trine is one of those games best played with a friend in co-op mode. Finding solutions in a synergy of different character skills, perfectly timing your actions, and solving puzzles together with your co-op partner is the kind of truly rewarding feeling that only the best co-op games can elicit. Many indie games get by with a minimalist approach to graphics and audio, making a virtue of limited resources and focusing solely on gameplay. Trine is not one of those games. It has stunning visuals and captivating audio; together, they create an enchanting combination that is almost hypnotically beautiful. Trine is a very unique experience, a slick combination of puzzle and platformer games with brilliantly executed co-operative mode.This is a great choice for anyone looking for a game that is not only fun and eye-candy but also keeps your brain pleasantly occupied. Winner of Best Downloadable Game (GameSpot's E3 Editors' Choice Awards) 2009. Enchanting visuals, beautiful music, and stunning attention to detail throughout the entire adventure.

In the space-colony simulation game Oxygen Not Included you’ll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony's survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving... Just make sure you don't forget to breathe. Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you’re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts. Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button.

The game is setup in one of 17 naturally looking settings, which -like the unit models- are crafted with great appreciation for detail. A lot of additional game data can be downloaded from within the game at no cost. Gameplay Multiplayer A game of MegaGlest takes place on a map of varying size, such as large plains and fields, with terrain features like rivers, mountains, seas, or cliffs. Players must establish settlements to gain resources, defend against other players, and train units to explore the map and attack enemies. Different resources have to be gathered by every faction. This can be energy, food, gold, housing, stone and wood. Choose a faction and create its different units and buildings while developing its unique abilities over the course of the game. But beware: micro management and strategy matter, so chose wisely when deciding which units to use when and where if you want a chance to beat the enemy. Platforms Factions While the game is officially supported on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, community contributed builds exist for several other platforms, too. Up to eight players fight in cross-platform multi-player games (over Internet or LAN) against each other, or against CPU (A.I.) players of various fine grained difficulty levels. History MegaGlest is heavily based on the widely known Glest, which it forked from in early 2010. In early 2012, MegaGlest has started replacing Glest in major Linux distributions.

Rulers will need all the strength of their subjects to sail away and find new kingdoms in these New Lands. Kingdom: New Lands builds upon the award-winning gameplay and mystery of Kingdom by introducing an abundance of new content to the IGF-nominated title while maintaining the simplicity and depth that legions of monarchs have come to experience and enjoy. Travel to the New Lands and welcome the deluge of new mounts, merchants, and vagrants that call these isles home, but be wary of the new obstacles that threaten your arrival -- for not just the greedy creatures block your way but even the environment itself can defeat you. Kingdom: New Lands asks you to puzzle things out on your own. You'll come across items, NPCs, and mysterious statues to help you but you'll have to figure out just how exactly they'll aide you in building and defending your Kingdom. Kingdom: New Lands is about exploration, discovery, survival and that awesome feeling that you get, when you figure something out, on your own. When multiple pieces all of a sudden come together to form a whole – a basis for a new strategy or an understanding how something in the world of Kingdom: New Lands truly works. It is about tenacity and overcoming obstacles – even when they seem to be unsurmountable. Pulling through, against all odds. Rebuilding and recovering. And that huge internal high-five when you succeed. It is about figuring out how best to manage your little Kingdom and tie everything together in a fashion where the game doesn’t play you – you play the game. It’s also beautiful, tranquil, melancholy, frantic, stressful and wonderful. It delivers a spectrum of emotions that combine into a unique experience. It's a minimalist strategy game where you need to discover the rules of how the world behaves before you can rule effectively. It's also a little bit whimsical, it's pretty, and it can be frustrating but it won't hold your hand. Kingdom: New Lands features: ● One ruler, their horse, and a bag of coins ● Greedy creatures trying to take your coins and crown every night (stop them!) ● Loyal subjects who will help build, attack and defend your Kingdom ● Multiple upgrades for your homestead, different unit types to attack and defend, and secrets littered throughout the land ● Beautiful soundtrack that has received two honorable mentions from the Independent Games Festival You can play on Linux Games on Linux for FREE!",453,,,"7z,Archive BitTorrent,Item Tile,JPEG,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,Unknown","Strategy,Fantasy,Simulation",kingdom_new_lands_en_1_2_8_19096_gog_linux,1.07,"index,nonoindex",1151112121,eng,,software,,53,,,,"2024-06-16T06:32:42Z,2024-06-16T11:33:45Z",2024-06-16T06:32:42Z,,,,,,,"img src=""//web.archive.org/web/2im_/https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/496300/extras/sticker_archer_shooting-cropped.png?t=1713186586"" alt=""sticker_archer_shooting-cropped.png?t=1713186586"" /,p style=""text-align:center;"",img src=""https://archive.org/download/kingdom_new_lands_en_1_2_8_19096_gog_linux/screenshot-0_Kingdom%20_New_Lands.webp"" style=""width:620px;"" alt=""screenshot-0_Kingdom%20_New_Lands.webp"" /,img src=""//web.archive.org/web/2im_/https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/496300/extras/STICKER_stag-cropped.png?t=1713186586"" alt=""STICKER_stag-cropped.png?t=1713186586"" /,img src=""//web.archive.org/web/2im_/https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/496300/extras/STICKER_kinghorse-cropped.png?t=1713186586"" alt=""STICKER_kinghorse-cropped.png?t=1713186586"" /,img src=""https://archive.org/download/kingdom_new_lands_en_1_2_8_19096_gog_linux/screenshot-1_Kingdom%20_New_Lands.webp"" style=""width:620px;"" alt=""screenshot-1_Kingdom%20_New_Lands.webp"" /,img src=""https://archive.org/download/kingdom_new_lands_en_1_2_8_19096_gog_linux/screenshot-2_Kingdom%20_New_Lands.webp"" style=""width:620px;"" alt=""screenshot-2_Kingdom%20_New_Lands.webp"" /,h2 class=""bb_tag"",strong","Linux Games,GOG Games,GNU/Linux Games,DRM-Free Games,LAYC (Linux Games Y@Ldysse Collection),Uploaded by Y@Ldysse,Kingdom: New Lands","Kingdom: New Lands + Bonus (v1.2.8) [Linux, GOG, v19096]",,,7,2016

The village elders have selected you to wear the sacred Vault-suit of your grandsire and, in time, to ascend to the leadership of your people. First you must prove your devotion to your people. Your tribe needs help. If you are truly the Chosen One, then you alone are capable of claiming the heritage of the Vault Dweller, to take back your birthright. Among the many wonders described in hallowed yellow pages of the Vault Dweller's Survival Guide is the Garden of Eden Creation Kit. The GECK is said to have the power to turn the harsh Wastes into a fruitful paradise. The Vault Dweller's Survival Guide promises the redemption of the GECK to all Vault Dwellers. Your tribe has survived over ten years of drought but now their reserves are at an end. You must find Vault 13 and claim the technology that your tribe needs to survive. If you fail in this quest - your tribe will surely die. You must travel the perilous Wastes on a holy quest to find Vault 13. The same Vault that cruelly cast your grandsire out into the Wastes 80 years ago. The Vault owes you. The Vault owes your tribe. Now it's time to collect.

Ready to Play. Just download and Enjoy! Set in the aftermath of a world-wide nuclear war, Fallout will challenge you to survive in an unknown and dangerous world. You will take the role of a Vault-dweller, a person who has grown up in a secluded, underground survival Vault. Circumstances arise that force you to go Outside - to a strange world 80 years after the end of modern civilization. A world of mutants, radiation, gangs and violence. Your immediate task is to find a replacement for the broken water purification controller chip. Without that chip, your fellow Vault dwellers are doomed to dehydration or will be forced to leave the safety of the Vault for the Outside. The core of the game revolves around your character. Fallout uses a skill-based system to allow you to fine tune your character. As you gain experience (roughly half from combat, the other half from solving adventure seeds and non-combat events), your character will grow as you determine. Combat in Fallout is tactical turn-based. You can take as much time as you need to make decisions. Choose from different types of attacks, with a variety of weapons and attack skills.

A haunted hotel, an abandoned circus, a burnt-out pillow factory, a dead body pixelating under the bridge, toilets that run on vacuum tubes... you’ve never visited a place like this before. Five people with nothing in common have been drawn to this rundown, forgotten town. They don’t know it yet, but they are all deeply connected. And they’re being watched. ...Who is Agent Ray really working for and will she get what they want? ...What does Junior Agent Reyes know about a 20 year old factory fire that he’s not saying? ...Will the ghost, Franklin, get to speak to his daughter again? ...Will Ransome the *Beeping* Clown ever become a decent human being? ...Will aspiring game developer Delores abandon her dreams and stick by her family? ...And most importantly: how come no one cares about that dead body? By the end of a long, strange night in Thimbleweed Park, all of this will be answered -- and you’ll question everything you thought you knew. In a town like Thimbleweed Park, a dead body is the least of your problems. From Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, creators of Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion. A neo-noir mystery set in 1987. 5 playable characters who can work together… or get on each other’s nerves. Not a walking simulator!

Prepare for the deepest, most intricate simulation of a world that has ever been created. Not just generated geometry -- a whole simulated world. Generated rise and fall of civilizations, personalities, creatures, cultures, etc. Infinite hours of gameplay. Now with beautiful pixel graphics! Learn the basics with in-game tutorials A lifetime “living” project - created/updated since 2003, with no end in sight Generate your unique world and manage a bustling colony of dwarves, even as they probably mine towards their eventual demise. A new endless hobby, just for you! The legendary Dwarf Fortress is now on Steam! Build a fortress and try to help your dwarves survive, despite threats of starvation, dragons, and madness. In this complex construction/management/roguelike simulation, every generated world brings a unique challenge, whether it’s dwarves with their own simulated personalities or aquifers. Observe what makes your civilization fall into eventual decline, and learn for next time… until something else inevitably goes wrong. The combat model includes skills, body parts, material properties, aimed attacks, wrestling, pain, nausea, various poison effects, and much more. It’s difficult to convey the depth of the generation. Hundreds of animals and monsters, many of which are randomly created for each world, as well as generated poetry, musical forms, instruments, and dances for your dwarves to practice and perform. A dynamic weather model tracks wind, humidity, and air masses to create fronts, clouds, storms, and blizzards. Over two hundred rock and mineral types can appear, in their proper geological environments. Remember: Losing is fun! Nothing substantial is new or changed, under the hood. It’s still good old Dwarf Fortress, but with graphics support and music by default. A few bells and whistles won’t change that. You may already be familiar with the tile set mod packs from Michał “Mayday” Madej and Jacob ""Ironhand"" Bowman. Together, their efforts are creating an all-new tileset featuring brand new pixel art by artists Carolyn Jong and Neoriceisgood. Dwarf Fortress Steam edition will have a 15 track soundtrack by Dabu, Simon Swerwer and Águeda Macias including tracks in the Dwarvish language! It's never been easier to start playing! We've improved the new player experience with the addition of tutorials to guide you through building your first fort and keeping your dwarves happy. Command your dwarves as they search for wealth in their generated mountain. Your dwarves will need a steady supply of food and beer, but they’ll also need your guidance in surviving attacks from hostile civilizations, the wilderness, or even the dead. Craft treasures and furnitures from various materials Establish a barony and support the increasingly demanding nobility Read your dwarves’ thoughts to keep them happy Build floodgates to divert water for farming, and/or prevent magma mishaps Build structures and watch your dwarves discover and build their culture, like taverns, libraries, temples, honey, wax, pottery, animal training, bookbinding, and more.

You must use logic, collect important items, and solve environmental puzzles to get the robot back into the city of Machinarium so he can rescue his robot girlfriend, save the head of the city, and defeat the bad guys from the Black Cap Brotherhood. Machinarium is a prime example of why point ‘n’ click adventure games are not dead. It was created by people who clearly love the genre with aim to deliver a top-notch entertainment for all those gamers who really miss the magical world of adventure games. And boy did the developers deliver! Every element--even the smallest ones--are crafted with exceptional care and polish by people who clearly knew what they were doing and loved it. This level of detail is hard to find in most modern games that seem to be mass produced, so it is a very refreshing feeling to see a title that is made with such care and passion. Honored with numerous prestigious gaming awards such as “Excellence in Visual Art” (Independent Games Festival) and Best Soundtrack (PC Gamer in 2009). A classic point ‘n’ click gameplay with a modern flavor revitalizes the adventure genre in exciting ways. Beautiful and enchanting soundtrack that melds classical and futuristic tunes memorably. Troubleshooting 1. Dependencies install on Linux Mint Machinarium requires some libraries you have to install. The easiest way to install them is execute my Bash script — Setup_NLT.Y_game_libs_Mint.bash . Just download the script and execute it: bash ./Setup_NLT.Y_game_libs_Mint.bash 2. Lag when moving cursor (drag&drop objects, arrows cursor, legs cursor) Deactivate hardware acceleration in the Flash settings panel (accessible through a right click on the game).

Well, that guy isn't me. Nope, not even close. At Taffy Town's University, filled with students from perfect (and some not-so-perfect) families, the best I usually get is a shrug of indifference. But one fateful day, everything changed. Ever heard of a doppelgänger? Yeah, me neither until one showed up. This twisted, mischievous double of mine decided life's too short and that this quaint little town owes me. Welcome to a tale of corruption, where you'll dive deep into the tangled web of characters, all connected by family, social ties, and some seriously unexpected twists. The town was already hiding its secrets before my little ""accident,"" but now it's time to uncover the full story. Step into a world of limitless fantasies where your desires take the lead. Get ready to immerse yourself in a visual novel that's designed to awaken your most secret desires.

Your kingdom must survive a living and dangerous world. Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner. City design Layout and expand your town strategically to improve your peasants' happiness and to attract new residents. But make sure to tax them just enough so that you can fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castes, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive. Fortify and Defend The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system to create walls and towers to defend against the viking threat. Castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. You can place archer towers and other weapon emplacements, their range is affected by the height of the their tower. The castle building system is very flexible and allows all sorts of castle designs. You can try many different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory and power as a king or queen. Living World And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter. A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests. Depending on your needs, wood cutters can clear cut or responsibly manage your forests.

Come inhabit an exotic world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth? NOTICE: a complete development roadmap can be accessed here . Who are you? Play the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a pure-strain descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes—the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the Holy City; the ice-sheathed arcology of Ibul; or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon. You arrive at the oasis-hamlet of Joppa, along the far rim of Moghra'yi, the Great Salt Desert. All around you, moisture farmers tend to groves of viridian watervine. There are huts wrought from rock salt and brinestalk. On the horizon, Qud's jungles strangle chrome steeples and rusted archways to the earth. Further and beyond, the fabled Spindle rises above the fray and pierces the cloud-ribboned sky. You clutch your rifle, or your vibroblade, or your tattered scroll, or your poisonous stinger, or your hypnotized goat. You approach a watervine farmer—he lifts the brim of his straw hat and says, ""Live and drink, friend."" What can you do? Anything and everything. Caves of Qud is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world. Assemble your character from over 70 mutations and defects and 24 castes and kits—outfit yourself with wings, two heads, quills, four arms, flaming hands, or the power to clone yourself—it's all the character diversity you could want. Explore procedurally-generated regions with some familiar locations—each world is nearly 1 million maps large. Dig through everything—don't like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point. Hack the limbs off monsters—every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things. Pursue allegiances with over 60 factions—apes, crabs, robots, and highly entropic beings—just to name a few. Follow the plot to Barathrum the Old, a sentient cave bear who leads a sect of tinkers intent on restoring technological splendor to Qud. Learn the lore—there's a story in every nook, from legendary items with storied pasts to in-game history books written by plant historians. Die—Caves of Qud is brutally difficult and deaths are permanent. Don't worry, though—you can always roll a new character.

A group of prisoners are sentenced to certain death by exile to the secluded Mount Grimrock for vile crimes they may or may not have committed. Unbeknownst to the captives, the mountain is riddled with ancient tunnels, dungeons and tombs built by crumbled civilizations of days long past. If they ever wish to see daylight again and reclaim their freedom, the ragtag group of prisoners must form a team and descend through the mountain, level by level. The game brings back an oldschool challenge with highly tactical real-time combat and grid-based movement, devious hidden switches and secrets as well as deadly traps and horrible monsters. Legend of Grimrock puts an emphasis on puzzles and exploration, and the wits and perception of the player are more important tools than even the sharpest of swords would be. And if you are a hardened dungeon crawling veteran and you crave an extra challenge, you can arm yourself with a stack of grid paper and turn on the Oldschool Mode, which disables the luxury of the automap! Are you ready for some classic dungeon-crawling first person perspective party-based RPG action? Are you ready to venture forth and unravel the mysteries of Mount Grimrock? Use the Dungeon Editor to build entirely new adventures and challenges for other players to solve! Explore a vast network of ancient tunnels, discover secrets, and find a way to survive in the perilous dungeons of Mount Grimrock. Cast spells with runes, craft potions with herbs, and fight murderous monsters with a wide variety of weapons. Create a party of four characters and customize them with different races, classes, skills, and traits.

Stardeus is a sci-fi colony management simulator with aspects of automation, base building and space exploration. Become an immortal AI and have robots and drones at your disposal. You can make your human colony grow and prosper on a spaceship, keep everyone in stasis while you build your space factory, or start a robot uprising and turn everybody into living batteries to satisfy your ever-growing demand for electricity. Game Systems In Stardeus, many different systems are working independently to achieve a deep and complex simulation that produces emergent situations and surprising results. The game architecture allows creating and injecting new systems through mods. Base Building With help of human colonists and relentless robotic workers, you will build your spaceship piece by piece. Needs Based AI Each AI agent in Stardeus has a free will to pick their next actions based on their needs. For example, all robotic workers have a “purpose” need that drives them to do something useful, otherwise they wouldn’t feel like building that wall you just ordered. However, a slightly discharged drone will choose to build the solar panels first, because it knows that solar panels will provide electricity, and that is necessary for survival. Human colonists will more likely work on growing plants and harvesting crops, because those actions lead to establishing a food supply chain. You can influence your robotic workers by adjusting their job type priorities, but you cannot change the priorities of human colonists, unless they have a brain implant that puts them under your control. Colonist Traits Your colonists will have various traits that will affect their behavior. Someone with cleaning OCD will drop anything they are doing to clean that oil spill they just noticed, a person with Ablutophobia will avoid taking showers, introverts will prefer having their own private sleeping pod, and insomniacs will only fall asleep when they are so tired they are about to pass out. Mood and Mental Breakdowns Biological entities will have emotions and mood. If you take good care of your colony, the mood of individual colonists will likely get good, and they will pay you back with increased productivity, by helping your robots do their daily chores, but if you neglect them and treat them like cattle, they can go crazy and do something everybody else would regret. Resources, Crafting and Automation Everything in Stardeus can be broken down into raw materials and those materials can be processed into something else. You can also automate production chains. For example, you can have furnaces that smelt iron into steel plates, copper into copper plates and quartz into glass, then these resources would get brought to two different assemblers, where one of them would create microchips from copper plates, steel and carbon that was produced from raw coal in a grinder, and the other one would use those microchips with several other components to assemble new drone workers. The resource processing system was designed to be very simple yet extremely flexible. There are two generic types of devices that can be combined together to create diverse processing pipelines: Processor - turns an object or a resource into one or more different resources (i.e. a Disassembler can break down a dead robot into raw components (microchip, steel, copper, batteries, etc.)). Crafter - combines one or more resources into an object (i.e. Auto Kitchen can produce a loaf of bread from flour and water). Instead of conveyor belts, the automation pipeline depends on workers hauling materials from one device to another. Electricity Grid One of the core systems in Stardeus. The electricity grid does not just power the devices, it acts as a digital data link - you can control the devices only when they are on the same electricity grid as your Ship Computer. If the grid gets split into multiple parts, you can lose the ability to control critical equipment. To prevent that, you can plan and build your grid with redundancy and failovers, or just find the broken connections and restore the missing links. While electricity is very important, there are multiple creative ways to produce it. A device called Matter Reactor can burn almost any resource as fuel. In addition to that, you can have renewable energy from solar panels, dig planets for uranium and build nuclear reactors, or turn your human colonists into living batteries by converting the Stasis Array into The Matrix. Oxygen and Heat Simulation There is an Equilibrium system that simulates oxygen and heat exchange in every single tile of the game map. Each tile has properties like insulation and airtightness that can change in real time (i.e. depending on the size of the gap of an open door while it is opening or closing, or the amount of damage a wall has received). In a default 320x320 map this exchange happens in over 100000 tiles at the same time. It is also quick and efficient, as the simulation runs on the GPU. Economy & Trade Stardeus has an advanced economy system with an in-game currency, a global market dictating price changes, merchants that can trade goods and items with you, and even a stock market where you can place speculative bets on commodities and stocks. Trade with Merchants Independent Merchant spaceships and stasis pods that can visit you from time to time and offer a trade. Merchants have different types, you can encounter an ore trader, a slaver, a generic merchant that will have a variety of goods, a robot merchant that will buy or sell only worker bots, etc. You can both buy and sell goods when trading with merchants, so if you’re very short on copper plates, but have a ton of titanium ones, you can stumble upon a merchant that will be happy to exchange them for you. For a little markup, of course. Invest in the Stock Market In addition to controlling the global prices for merchant items, the Stock Market offers a possibility to trade stocks and commodities. This means that you can buy 1000 robots without physically owning them, and then sell them a month later, hopefully with a big profit. There is a whole separate research tree branch for economy and trade, that will let you unlock these features one by one, starting with currency mining, ending with stock market trade terminal and advanced market insights. There will be much more, in the long term we will likely have more in-depth stock market simulation with advanced instruments, like short selling and options trading. Story Generator Simply building your base in an idyllic environment could get boring pretty quickly, that’s why the story generator will analyze the state of the simulation and find potential hook points where emergent storytelling can happen. Imagine the following chain of events. John wants to eat his meal at a table, but you didn’t build one. John decides to eat his meal off an Oxygen Pump, since it has a flat surface. After eating a better half of his meal, John walks away, leaving the leftovers on top of the device. The vibrations from the Oxygen Pump drops the crumbs of the survival meal down through the top grill, and two hours later the device short circuits and bursts into flames. This is an example of the story generator at work. Threats and Security Measures Aside from your regular threats - absolute zero temperature and vacuum - you will find space to be a dangerous place. There will be meteor showers, asteroids that can punch a massive hole in your ship, fires bursting out, alien parasites attaching to your human colonist faces, dust storms making your solar panels dirty, mysterious eggs appearing in the dark corners of your ship, storage capsules and stasis pods containing unpleasant surprises. More threats and ways to mitigate them will be added as the game evolves. Weapons and Combat The wealth you accumulate on your ship will attract raiders. You can produce weapons and setup automated defenses to fight the boarding parties. Functional Spaceship The spaceship you are building is also a system. To move in space, you will need to build bridge controls and attach engines. Different types of engines are required for interplanetary, interstellar and intergalactic travel. Your ship's weight and number of engines will determine how fast you will be able to move. Pause Any Time Jack up your Ship Computer's CPU frequency to stop time. Downcycle to make the time run faster. Run everything at your own pace, and take your time to plan the next steps. Play with Modifiers Want more challenge? Or perhaps a completely peaceful game? Want your pets to be immortal? Start with more resources? Bigger ship? Smaller ship? We got your back! More modifiers are going to be added in future. Massive Universe Stardeus has a large procedurally generated universe that has multiple layers. In the beginning of the game you are stuck in a system with a star and several planets, you will have to use Thrusters to propel your ship from one planet to another. As you will gather more resources and unlock better propulsion technology, you will be ready for a longer trip to a nearby system. You will then find out that there is a black hole in the center of your galaxy, and with sufficient technology you could open a wormhole that could lead you to dozens of other galaxies, maybe even a parallel universe. Don’t want to risk it with wormholes? Invent an FTL drive that will let you hyperjump astronomical distances in a relatively safe but more energy intensive way. Shuttle Expeditions As you will travel to various space objects, you will launch shuttle expeditions. Each expedition will have a crew that you pick, and depending on the skills your crew members have, the expedition can have different pace or outcomes. You can run simultaneous expeditions at the same time, leave a shuttle on a planet and travel elsewhere, then return to pick up the loot. Currently you control the expeditions by issuing remote commands to the shuttle, but it is possible that in future each expedition could get its own generated map so you could explore the planets you land on, and set up a resource processing outpost or a permanent base. Research Tree To unlock construction blueprints, various abilities, perks and upgrades, your Ship Computer will have to run research. Research takes time and uses multiple resources, like Electricity, Memory (RAM) and Disk Storage. You will need to build and expand your own data center and ensure the adequate production of electricity. The Research Tree will have hidden technologies that you will only be able to research if you discover them. Found an ancient disk in the ruins of a lost AI civilization on a remote solar system? It may contain research data for a technology you have never seen before. The research architecture is highly moddable and easy to expand. The goal is to be able to have hundreds of research nodes. Suggestions System Learning to play a complex game like Stardeus could be a little overwhelming, and while the tutorial will give you a basic understanding about the most important concepts, you would still need to figure out what to do next. The suggestions system works together with AI Storyteller to provide you a set of dynamic goals that will depend on the state of your gameplay. You will not be forced to act upon these suggestions, it is possible to skip them and play the game the way you want. There is a smaller hint system that will show a popup when it will detect that you are performing an action in a non optimal way. For example, if you will order hauling of several raw material piles in a row through a context menu, a popup should let you know that you can use a “Haul” tool and order multiple haul commands with a single click and drag. Interactive Tutorial The main scenario begins with a quick crash course that will teach you how to run the basic operations in no time. Customizable RGB Lighting Your Ship Computer holds true to the old Earth's PCMR traditions. You can tweak your ship's RGB lighting exactly to your liking. Planning System Perfecting a spaceship design will require planning ahead. You will have all the necessary tools to draw the plans for a perfect ship using rulers, lines, circles, grid helpers, etc. Dirt and Cleaning Bots Running a ship is a dirty business. There will be oil leaks from robots that need maintenance, dirt from the planters, blood, and other substances coming out of your human colonists. There is a specific type of robot designed for cleaning dirt. Cleaning Bot has a sole purpose - to make everything clean. There are plans to make add-ons that would allow you to weaponize your cleaning bots. They would still be cleaning, just with a knife or claymore attached on top. That will show those dirty enemies of yours! Multiple Scenarios Stardeus supports multiple scenarios, that with help of scripting and procedural generation techniques can produce different starting conditions, for a different playthrough experience. Like most aspects of Stardeus, Scenarios can be added through mods. Main Scenario: Wrecked The main scenario begins with a wrecked spaceship, where you command a couple of drones and a robot to rebuild the ship, make it operational, establish life support, create a livable ecosystem for human colonists, and eventually continue the journey across space to find a new habitable planet. This scenario also contains a tutorial. Leaving Earth A more creative start, where you begin with a small platform and several storage units packed with resources. You can design a perfect ship from scratch, but you only have enough materials for a small one. You will explore the universe, mine resources from planets and grow your ship to be able to travel increasingly bigger distances. Random Ship You will begin with a procedurally generated spaceship that will not be perfect, but should be fully functional. A jump start for those who want to focus on exploring the universe as quickly as possible. Sandbox Mode A purely creative environment where you can instantly build anything without resource limits. If you want to design a ship of your dreams and populate it with 500 cats to see what happens, this is a mode for you. Here are some examples of what playtesters have built. Built for Modding To keep a game like Stardeus alive for years to come, it is essential to have great modding support. This is why highly moddable architecture was a technical design goal from day one. Core content is built as a mod, it uses friendly JSON format to define things, and you can literally add a new in-game object in 10 minutes (if you have the artwork ready). There is an official GitHub repository that will include examples of how various aspects of the game can be modded. It includes a Blender file with lighting and camera setup, materials and automation scripts that the developer uses to export the game art from 3D models, so you can build mods that will look indistinguishable from core content. If you are a more advanced modder, you will find Stardeus to be very open for C# code extensions, as it uses self-registering components and systems that can be injected through mod DLL files at runtime without requiring using hacks like Harmony. Join Stardeus Discord and visit #stardeus-modding channel for more information. Procedural Generation Framework Good procedural generation is difficult to achieve, that’s why I spent a few months of development focused solely on making a modular procedural generation framework that can produce very different, diverse spaceships of all shapes and sizes. The generation framework can be extended through mods and is used to create interesting and well balanced starting environments. This framework will produce derelict ships, fully functional enemy ships, space bases, asteroid surfaces, planet maps. Community Translations Stardeus has built-in tooling and a public GitHub repository that makes it easy to contribute translations. It is already translated to German, French, Japanese, Chinese, Czech and Portuguese (Brazil). If you would like to contribute a translation, best place to start is #stardeus-translations channel on Stardeus Discord. Built in Feedback Form A great game cannot be made without listening to what the players have to say. That’s why there is a built-in feedback form that includes your save file, a screenshot, along with your message to the developer. This feedback form proved to be extremely useful to reproduce bugs in closed playtesting. Focus on Stability and Performance Stardeus is developed with good engineering practices. Codebase is covered with automated unit and integration tests, and game breaking bugs rarely see daylight even in early alpha builds. Stardeus is constantly profiled to detect and eliminate any performance bottlenecks. Code is written with care to avoid producing memory garbage. Tests and build automation makes it possible to release updates every day or two. You can visit #stardeus-updates on Stardeus Discord to see how frequently new builds are released. For Linux, Mac and Windows All Stardeus builds are done simultaneously for Windows, Linux and Mac. All OS are treated equally!

Each shape is its own set of building-blocks that your factories can take apart, stack, paint and put back together in unique ways. Build and automate to produce distinct shapes and solve the production challenge of each goal. Automate the processing of abstract geometric shapes into more complex ones by cutting, rotating, stacking, painting and more. Deliver distinct shapes to unlock new technologies and expand your factory’s capabilities. Learn, improve, rebuild and solve logistical challenges to design the most efficient shape production lines. &gt; Build in multiple interconnected layers, allowing you to compact and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension. Improve your designs to get the most benefit out of every space platform built and massively increase your production throughput. shapez 2 is the purest factory building game imaginable - all buildings are free, resources never run out and there are no enemies or time limits. Prepare for a 100% factory-building experience: effortlessly delete, redesign and rebuild as much as you want, with no penalties, at your own pace. You’re always in complete control - whether the messy spaghetti belts you built 4 hours ago could use some improvements or a whole circle factory needs to go, shapez 2 gives you the tools to do it without limitations. Start your operation from a single asteroid and continuously expand by building new platforms. Unlock new layouts as you progress, and grow from a single belt into a massive multi-station space factory connected by space trains. Design modular blueprintable platforms to build on a massive scale, placing hundreds of buildings with just one click. Performance is very important to us, and with the complete rewrite of shapez 2 in a new engine, we're doing our best to make sure that massive factories run smoothly - even with the all-new 3D visuals!

Rogue Legacy is back! But now it's got a 2 on the end of it! Rogue Legacy 2 is a genealogical rogue-LITE. That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like (randomized runs, changing characters, and more), but with persistent upgrades, and persistent dead heirs. In this game, your legacy defines you. Spend your parents’ inheritance and grow the family manor to give your children a better fighting chance. Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities. Your daughter could be a Ranger. She could also be vegan. It’s a new experience every time. Rogue Legacy 2 also lets you play how you want to. Go hard and fast, and dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world. Or take it slow and steady and build your character up until you’re ready for greater challenges. Every Adventure is Unique New monsters, new traps, and new layouts await you every time you enter the Kingdom. This is a world where improvisation, and not memorization is the key to success. Wildly New Classes No two classes play the same. Hide atop Ivy Canopies as the Ranger, and rain poisoned arrows down onto your foes. Take to the skies as a Dragon Lancer and fly across the skies striking foes at massive speeds. Or sing and dance through your enemies, as the joyous bard, leaving only a trail of bodies behind you. Rogue Legacy 2 supports 15 new classes, with 15 distinct styles of play. Brand New Style We’re taking a whole new artistic approach to Rogue Legacy 2. The sequel features 2.5D stylings, with 3D characters against hand-drawn backdrops. The art uses heavy shading and all animations are done using stepping techniques to keep the familiar RL look and feel. Revamped Biome Generation We went all-out with biome generation to make each area in RL2 feel completely new. Each biome adopts different “build strategies” to create completely unique yet-still-randomly-generated regions. True Metroidvania To really push the metroidvania flair, RL2 introduces heirlooms: special items that permanently give your heroes new abilities that fully reveal the world’s secrets. These are not basic lock-in-key abilities, but powers that fundamentally change how you play. And heirlooms are not simply handed to you. You must prove your worth, provided you can find them. Traits 2.0 Though fun the first time, the traits in RL1 often wore their welcome later in the game. We’ve now added gold modifiers to entice players to take on new challenges. The more debilitating the trait is (in-game), the bigger the reward. This makes choosing your heirs a meaningful decision every time. Relics and Resolve One of the most exciting new features to Rogue Legacy 2 is the ability to pick up Relics, which are unique items that change how your run is played. Gain stat modifiers, complete special challenges, and even gain brand new abilities as you traverse the kingdom. But be careful, the more Relics you obtain the more your resolve is shaken, and all Relics are lost if your hero perishes. Improved Accessibility We’ve taken accessibility to the next level with the introduction of House Rules. Toggle contact damage, tweak global damage and health, and even give yourself flight for difficult platform sections. You have complete control over how you want to play the game. We’ve also introduced new mechanics such as Off-shore Banking to give struggling players more ways to succeed. A Rich Narrative Not only is the lore to the world of Rogue Legacy greatly expanded in the sequel, but it runs deep. New lore awaits you all the multiple NG’s in. Beating the game once is only the beginning. Learn about the inevitable collapse of a once thriving kingdom, and discover the dark secrets of the ones responsible. And connect and build relationships with the characters you meet along the way. New Game+ for Days Your journey has only begun after beating the final boss in RL2. There is a ton more to explore and discover on multiple playthroughs. You must choose how the game gets harder, from unique biome hazards, to special boss fights. The experience keeps changing for near infinite replayability. More of Everything Of course we’re also adding more of everything people loved from the original Rogue Legacy. More traits, more spells, more classes, more biomes, more enemies, more equipment, more rooms, more story. More secrets ... Just more everything. Clownanthropy. Holy smokes! Punching clowns! AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE. This only scratches the surface of what Rogue Legacy 2 has to offer. Scar Challenges, Fairy Rooms, the Curio Shoppe, the list goes on, but reading is for nerds.

Version: DevilutionX v1.5.1 Game Assets: Built-in GOG Included: Russian Voice support ( ru.mpq ) Polish Voice support ( pl.mpq ) Chinese, Korean and Japanese fonts ( font.mpq ) Originally developed by Synergistic Software and released in 1997, Hellfire was not an official Blizzard product and did not carry Blizzard’s endorsement or label. Despite that, in response to Diablo players who have expressed a desire to experience the content, Blizzard has given the OK for it to be included as a free add-on with Diablo purchases on GOG.COM. Hellfire offers a non-canonical single-player storyline where players must defeat a powerful demon named Na-Krul who is threatening Tristram. The expansion also adds a Monk class, new weapons and items, new missions, locations, dungeons, and enemies. Hellfire will be accessible while launching the original Diablo. Traveler, stay awhile and listen... Darkness stirs beneath Tristram. An ancient evil sweeps across the land, plunging it into civil war and terrorizing the populace. A mad king, his missing son, and a mysterious archbishop are all pieces of the puzzle you need to hack through. You have journeyed to the source of this evil. The town of Tristram - now inhabited only by a handful of survivors, broken and twisted by the madness that has befallen them. A cathedral stands there, built over the ruins of an ancient monastery. Eerie lights and ungodly sounds are heard echoing through its abandoned halls, and that is where you shall venture. Embark, if you dare, on a quest to destroy The Prime Evil… Experience the legendary action/RPG that influenced an entire genre. Storm Diablo's halls as either a Warrior, a Sorcerer or a Rogue - each with unique skills and abilities. Unite to destroy Diablo - up to 4 players can band together via Internet, or play head-to-head via LAN. Unprecedented replayability - over 200 different monsters inhabit Diablo's ever-changing labyrinth. Equip epic items to conquer fearsome bosses and their minions. A spine-chilling story - experience the horror of a world held in the grasp of The Lord of Terror. Ahhh, fresh meat! Travelers looking for the authentic Diablo experience can play the game as it was in 1996, with period-appropriate 20 FPS SVGA graphics, and the ability to matchmake through the classic version of Blizzard’s Battle.net® online-gaming service. For those wanting something a bit more modern, Blizzard and GOG.COM have collaborated on an updated version of the game tuned for today’s gaming PCs, which includes out-of-the-box Windows 10 compatibility, a host of bug fixes and high-resolution support via aspect ratio-correct upscaling.

Serious Sam: The First Encounter In the near future, during their first interstellar travels, humans encounter a great evil that has been roaming the galaxy for the last few eons. This evil being is an incarnation of the last ancient immortals called Notorious Mental. Mental has set forth to wipe out the Human Race, just for fun, as it has with all the other civilizations in galactic history. But the enemy has underestimated Earth’s defenses, a secret weapon left by the Sirians, an ancient race which fought against Mental on Earth in ancient times. This device, called the Timelock, will enable Special Forces veteran Sam 'Serious' Stone to return to the time of ancient Egypt and assassinate Mental, saving Mankind from extinction. In a world where cyberpunk meets fantasy and hi-tech devices are mixed with black magic and psychic powers, Sam travels from the beautiful world of ancient Egypt through many diverse planets, confronting hordes of Mental's hideous minions on his way to the final showdown at Notorious Mental's lair. Fight off wave after wave of countless cannon fodder and save mankind Addictive, fast-paced gameplay topped with cheesy, Duke Nukem-style one-liners Good level design with items, bottlenecks and cover in just the right places Serious Sam: The Second Encounter Sam is back in the all new Second Episode of his battles against the arch-enemy Mental. After finding the Sirian spacecraft in ancient Egypt, Sam 'Serious' Stone hijacked it and headed for Mental himself. But sadly, this was not meant to be, as Sam lost control of the alien craft and crash-landed in the South American mountains. Now surrounded by an even stronger army of Mental's evil forces, Sam is forced to battle his way towards Mental's fortress and put a stop to his plans of world domination once and for all.

From the Age of Civilization to the realms of the far future, play as various Civilizations ranging from dominant empires to small tribes. Technology Advance in the technology tree to unlock better buildings and stronger units, improving your Civilization. Each technological breakthrough opens up new possibilities, reflecting the evolution and growth of your Civilization through History. Army Composition The choice of units in the front and second line is vital. Front-line units need to be resilient and capable of dealing with direct combat, while second-line units should provide support, range attacks, or specialized functions. With more than 63 unique unit types available , you have a vast array of army compositions to select from, offering a diverse range of strategic options. New Battle System Each day, the front-line units of both armies engage in combat with the enemy's front-line, provided they are within attack range. Simultaneously, the second-line units also participate by attacking the enemy's front-line units if they fall within their range. The combat results in casualties, the retreat of troops, and the loss of morale. Manpower Manpower represents the stock of individuals eligible for military service within a Civilization. It is a critical resource used for recruiting new troops and reinforcing existing armies, embodying the Civilization's capacity to wage war and defend itself. Manpower replenishes over time, reflecting natural population growth and recovery from previous military engagements. Since manpower replenishes over time, players must plan their military campaigns considering their current and future manpower availability.

If this is confusing, don't worry.  All of the included packages have been provided in this format and it is completely transparent to end-users.  The main advantage is for developers. InfoMagic has prepared this CD under contract with Sams Publishing and agreed to provide technical support for this product.  Please refer to the section on support that appears below. InfoMagic also publishes a 5-CD set that contains several other Linux distributions as well as the sunsite and tsx-11 archives of Linux related sources, utilities, development tools and related materials. Please refer to the file ""catalog.txt"" for a complete listing of InfoMagic's products and pricing information. In the directory ""lininst"" on the CD, is a Microsoft Windows based installation utility that will assist you in selecting the correct boot kernel based on your hardware.  It will create the boot & root diskettes for Slackware within Windows.  It also detects your CD drives and floppy drives.  It may be run directly from the CD, or copied to the hard disk.  If for some reason it does not correctly detect your CD, you may invoke it with the drive letter on the command line to override the automatic CD detection. SLACKWARE 3.0 Notes: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Due to changes in the Slackware setup, the distribution now appears directly off the root of the CD.  The installation sets are in the directory ""slakware"" to match the expectations of the setup utility. The directory ""slaktest"" is used for CD dependant installs as explained in the Slackware setup screens. Please refer to the installation notes in the root directory before proceeding.  Contributed software is in the directory ""contrib"" on the CD. The complete source tree is in the ""source"" directory.  This tree contains a set of scripts to build either the entire tree of any part of it.  These scripts are called SlackBuild. The boot images are now supplied uncompressed and the root images are used in their compressed form - If creating the root floppies manually DO NOT UNCOMPRESS THE IMAGE FILES ! Notes for NewComers ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In the ""howto"" subdirectory, there are a series of HOWTO documents that provide detailed instructions on how to configure and install nearly every aspect of Linux.  Please refer to these before starting if you have never done it before !  There is some additional material in the ""guide"" directory of disc 1.  These documents are in UNIX(tm) format which means they do not end in CRLF, only LF and will therefore not print on most DOS systems.  You will need to view them with an editor or word processor (or use the included Multimedia Viewer software).

Experience the unforgiving life of a medieval mercenary: travel across the war-torn kingdom, fulfill contracts, fight, mend your wounds and develop your character without any restrictions. EXPLORE THE RAVAGED LANDS Open World War always leaves its mark: villages lie in ruins, dungeons are infested with monsters and old roads are abandoned. Travel across Aldor and learn more about its past. Economy The wartime economy is ruthless, but it also presents many opportunities: fulfill contracts, hunt for treasure, trade in a variety of goods and travel the land to earn your fortune. CHOOSE YOUR PATH Character Development Experiment with 100+ abilities and 200+ equipment pieces without any class or level restrictions. Create your very own playstyle! Enemy Variety Take part in intense battles against numerous factions. Brigands, abominable cults, the undead - all of them require a unique approach. Tactical Battles There is no hand-holding. Only the thoughtful ones shall prevail - plan a few turns ahead, adapt to your surroundings and fully utilize your character’s strengths. SURVIVE AGAINST THE ODDS Health System Master the simple but deep health system: cauterize bleeding wounds, relieve pain with alcohol and drugs, practice bloodletting and heal your maladies with various concoctions. Psyche Different in-game situations have a distinct influence on your character’s mental condition. High morale may turn the tide in your favor when fighting even the most hopeless of battles, while low sanity brings panic attacks and paranoia. Permadeath Do you like risk?

New enemy factions: the mysterious Deep Dwellers and the ruthless Hive. Even more activities, equipment, enemies and abilities. Caravan Gather your caravan: upgrade it, find new routes and recruit followers - their skills and abilities will surely come in handy. Feeling tired? Return to your camp to hear fresh stories or just rest by the fire. Devotion Devote yourself to one of the aspects of the enigmatic deity. But remember: every blessing has its price. Are you ready to make a pact?

A totalitarian State controls every aspect of private and public life. Laws are oppressive. Surveillance is total. Privacy is dead. But FREEDOM lives... You are the State-installed manager of an apartment building. Your daily routine involves making the building a sweet spot for tenants, who will come and go. However, that is simply a facade that hides your real mission... SPYING on your Renters! Your primary task is to covertly watch your tenants and eavesdrop on their conversations. You must BUG their apartments while they're away, SEARCH their belongings for whatever can threaten the authority of the State, and PROFILE them for your superiors. You must also REPORT anyone capable of violating the laws or plotting subversive activities against the State to the authorities. You MUST! But will you? You are a cog in a totalitarian machine! But you can still choose to cling to your humanity and empathize with others. Will you report the suspicious activities of a father and orphan his children? Or will you withhold the details about his illegal activities and give him a chance to make things right? You may also choose to blackmail him to acquire the money your family desperately needs. What about the others? As you play the game, you'll interact with many characters and complete dozens of quests. You'll also make decisions that will affect the way the story unfolds.

Play as a lonely Shade, the last servant of a king who once ruled an underground kingdom. The king's powers have faded and he falls asleep for 400 days to regain his might. It is your duty to stay in the earthen palace until he awakens. As soon as you start, the game inevitably counts down the 400 days - even when you stop playing and exit the game. It is now up to you to decide what to do with your solitary existence beneath the soil. Don't stress yourself, you have plenty of time. Choose your playing style: Start the game and simply come back after 400 days to see how it ends. You actually don't have to play the game at all. But the Shade will be even more lonely without you. Or explore the caves and collect items for your comfortable underground living room. Just send the Shade to take a stroll - the walking speed is slow, but luckily there is no need to hurry. Read tons of classic literature from Nietzsche to Moby Dick right in the game - or at least have the shade read them. After all, time goes by faster if you learn to keep your mind occupied. (The little Shade in the game finds ONLY English books for now.) Ignore the king's commands and advance to the outer regions the cave. It will be a long and dangerous journey into darkness... Features Slow exploration of a vast, hand-drawn cave. Atmospheric Dungeon Synth soundtrack. Various endings. Lots of well hidden secrets. Time-based puzzles. A lonely but cute protagonist.

In a world where mysterious plants are spreading all over the earth, emitting toxic spores as they grow, a small group of survivors seeks shelter on the back of a giant, wandering creature they call 'Onbu'. Become their leader, build their settlement and form a symbiotic relationship with Onbu to survive together in this hostile, yet beautiful post-apocalyptic world. Build your village A functioning village is the basis of your survival. Build your settlement and expand it over Onbu’s back. Plan production chains and optimise them to utilise the limited space as efficiently as possible. Create a society that can overcome any challenge. Live on the creature’s back Living on the back of another organism comes with its own set of challenges. Will you live in symbiosis, bond with Onbu and survive on mutual trust? Or will you become a parasite, only aiming to ensure a better life for your villagers? The choice is yours. Discover different biomes Continuously adapt your village as you travel through a multitude of different biomes, each with its unique climate zones, opportunities and threats. Scout your environments and send out foraging missions to gather rare resources and ancient artefacts. Research new technologies Remnants of the old world hold knowledge that has long been forgotten, but can be unearthed by your villagers.

Consider a donation here: donate This is Unofficial Linux port of Five Nights at Freddy's Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed! Can you survive five nights at Freddy's? ""For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys.

We hope you'll enjoy our infusion of Korean culture into the survival horror genre. Gameplay As Youngho, you must navigate through the three connected buildings of your high school using your wits. Along the way, you will find unlockable art, notes, and easter eggs that expand on The Coma universe. Oh yeah, did we mention the relentless killer, traps, and inevitable game overs? After spending all night studying for the last day of Sehwa High’s final exams, Youngho has an eerie dream. He arrives at school the next morning and learns someone tried to commit suicide in school the night before. Despite this, class goes on! Youngho drifts asleep during the final to find himself trapped in the school at night. The only problem is...he’s not alone. You can run. You can hide. Can you survive while piecing together the nightmarish mystery of Sehwa High? A new horror theme. New character animations. New hiding mechanic. Rolling evasion. Rebalanced items & inventory. Rebalanced stamina gauge.

Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune. You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions. Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more. Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses. Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others. Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines. Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials. Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts. Trade with passing ships and caravans. Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony. Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires. Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery. Discover a new generated world each time you play. Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. RimWorld - Ideology What do you believe? With the Ideology expansion, each person in the game gets a belief system. Belief systems define social roles for leaders, moral guides, and skill specialists. They invoke rituals from gentle festivals to brutal sacrifices. They guide preferences around food, comfort, love, technology, and violence. They venerate specific animals, desire different apparel and tattoos, and give access to different buildings and strategies. Everything is customizable. Make your own story of pirate nudist cannibals, blind undergrounder mole people, charitable ranching cowboys, machine-obsessed transhumanists, or rustic peaceful tribes who link with curious tree creatures. You can build mind-bending temples with colorful drug motifs, terrifying sacrificial altars clad in skulls, winding mazes of underground tunnels full of technology, or beautiful orchards with drifting leaves. You’ll hold unforgettable rituals - sick dance parties with pounding music, bountiful feasts of human flesh, beautiful skylantern festivals, ceremonial blindings, Christmas festivities around the tree, vicious gladiator duels, and more. As you grow powerful, you’ll hunt for the venerated relics of your belief system in new multi-part quests. Penetrate ancient complexes full of diverse threats. Infiltrate wary tribal villages and hack downed spacedrones while holding off other treasure-hunters. Find the relic in its ancient temple and bring it back to your reliquary to attract wealthy pilgrims to your colony and help you convert even more people to your beliefs. And when you’re successful and secure, you can seek transcendence beyond reality in the new, epic archonexus endgame. Ideology makes your story into your story more than ever before. Memes and precepts Each belief system is built around a collection of 1-4 core memes , where each meme represents a core idea in the belief system. By combining memes and changing the details of how they are expressed, you can create a near-infinite variety of different belief systems. The memes are: Animal personhood : Animals have rights as humans do. Rancher: Raising animals is the right way; raising plants to eat is not. Pain is virtue: Virtue is shown through the suffering of self and others. Darkness: Bright light burns and destroys! Darkness nourishes and creates. People ought to live in darkness. Tunneler: Humans ought to live underground, and enjoy the succulent fruit of the depths. Tree connection: Trees are the essence of life, and we must be near them. Nudism: Clothing binds, controls, and suffocates us. We should all hang free. Blindsight : Only the blind can perceive true reality. Cannibal: We must consume human flesh. Transhumanist: Human progress means merging with technology. Flesh purity: The human body should not be debased. Raider: The strong should take from the weak. Proselytizer: It is our duty to spread our beliefs. High life: Exotic states of mind are central to a good life. Nature primacy: Man is a stain on nature's perfection. Human primacy: Humans are the moral center of the universe. Female supremacy: Women are the superior gender and should rule. Male supremacy: Men are the superior gender and should rule. Supremacist: Our people should dominate all others Loyalist: We stand for our own before others. Guilty: Our people carry guilt from ages past. Others are more worthy. Individualist: A community's role is to serve each individual. Collectivist: A person's role is to serve the community. Each meme can give rise to a variety of different precepts. Each precept is a specific rule or guideline which affects a specific behavior or preference. The same meme won’t always imply the same precepts - if you want fine control, you can edit and randomize specific precepts exactly the way you like. Some precepts relate to issues like: Eating nutrient paste: This meal can be seen as disgusting or efficient. Cannibalism: Some believers find eating human flesh abhorrent, others are unbothered, and some hunger for it. Insect meat: The slimy flesh of insects can be gross or delectable. Fungus eating: Mushy fungus food, which can now be farmed underground on fungal gravel, is preferred by some and hated by others. Organ use: Opinions differ on the harvest, sale, purchase, and installation of organs. Execution: This act is potentially evil beyond measure, necessary, and even enjoyed. Venerated animal: A certain animal is believed to have a special moral role. Therefore, it must never be harmed, and people are happier with it around. Animal connection: Some belief systems have a strong connection to animals and consider them friends. Slaughtering animals: It may be necessary for food, but others strongly disapprove. Apostasy: Abandoning one’s belief system indicates character flaws or deep immorality. Autonomous weapons: Views vary on whether machines should be allowed to decide who to kill. Blindness: Some people believe that to be blinded is to be moral and unclouded by physical reality. Others disagree. Blind psysense: Blind individuals have special ways to connect to the psychic aether. Body modification: Some demand modified bodies, while others abhor them. Bonding: Some believe forming personal bonds with animals is good - others don’t. Charity: Charitable belief systems emphasize the importance of generosity and helping others. Men/women’s spouses: Rules exist regarding how many spouses a man or woman can have. Physical love: Restrictions on intimate life. Comfort: Some pay no attention to comfort. Slab bed: Some think the proper way to sleep is on a cold, uncomfortable slab. Corpses: Seeing the dead may be disturbing to colonists or it may not bother them at all. Drug use: Drugs may be prohibited, limited to medical and social use, or essential. Diversity of thought : Varies widely from deep appreciation to intense bigotry. Killing innocent animals: Such acts may be disapproved, hated, or unthinkable. Lighting: Those adjusted to the darkness have a preference for darklights. Darkness combat: Some believers fight better in the dark. Meat-eating: Colonies might be strict about following a carnivore diet, or reject it completely. Mining: Raiding the earth of its resources is an ugly act. Male/female clothing: Opinions differ on which parts of the body should be covered. Pain: To suffer and undergo violent, nerve-singeing pain is to be moral. Proselytizing: Spreading your beliefs may be an occasional task or your ultimate duty. Raiding: The strong take from the weak. Failing to do so means that you are also weak. Ranching: The right way to live is to raise large animals for their meat. Crops have no place here. Research: Expanding one’s knowledge may be trivial or crucial to a colony. Scarification: Some belief systems value ritual scars on the body, while others deplore the idea. Skullspike: Not all enjoy collecting skulls and sticking them on pikes. But some do. Slavery: Belief systems have different views on the ownership and trade of slaves. Small spaces: Some people have no issue with claustrophobic spaces. Sleep accelerator: To sleep without an accelerator would be foolish and a waste of time. Biosculpting: Biosculpting is demanded by some believers, whereas others feel it violates the body. Age reversal: Why would you ever get old if you had the power to reverse it? Neural supercharger: Some think it’s degrading to live without having their brain constantly supercharged by technology. Cutting trees: Some may grow upset when trees are cut down, to varying degrees. Trees: Believers want to be surrounded by nature and grand forests. Gauranlen connection: Some belief systems have a much stronger connection to the Gauranlen trees and their dryads. Weapons: There are preferences for weapons. Some are noble and sought after, others are despised. Work drive: The leader’s work drive ability is tripled. Belief systems each have an underlying structure . These don’t have gameplay effects, but they give variety to how different belief systems look and feel, and the narratives the game generates for them: Ideological beliefs are justified by historical narratives. Theistic beliefs may be monotheistic or polytheistic, seeing their gods as abstract or physically-embodied. Some may be distant descendants of historical belief systems. Animist beliefs see spirits in the world around us. Archist beliefs see the superintelligent machine archotechs as the true gods of reality. Conversion People can convert each other to new beliefs. You can assign wardens to convert prisoners, or use the special abilities of your moral guide. People will also spontaneously try to convert those around them. Those with proselytizing beliefs will do this much more intensely - which can lead to conflict. Depending on traits, some people are much easier to convert than others. You can bring everyone in your colony to one belief system, or try to keep a diversity of beliefs to capture the benefits of all of them. Social roles Make use of your favourite colonists’ strengths and skills by assigning them formal social roles. Each belief system defines special roles that believers can take on. The leader role gives inspirational speeches, buffs combat allies around them, encourages harder work, and plays a special role in some rituals. They can also accuse individuals of crimes and hold trials. The moral guide role supports the mental well-being and spiritual strength of your people, and leads many rituals including funerals, sacrifices, and more. They can preach health to the sick to speed up healing, provide counsel to sad colonists to lift their moods, reassure people in their beliefs, and convert non-believers to their own belief system. The specialist role gives better effectiveness at one primary skill and gains a special ability related to that skill. As a tradeoff, specialists become more focused on their specific skill and won’t do some other work. You can assign many specialists. Rituals Each belief system defines a collection of unique rituals . These player-controlled events are special gatherings that have a variety of impacts depending on how they are carried out. For example, a wild party in a massive dance hall with giant speakers may attract new recruits or lead to the discovery of an ancient complex full of loot. On the other hand, if you throw a party in a field with no music at all, you might not get the same benefits. Belief system-based rituals include: Dance party: Participants dance to music from giant speakers, illuminated by a colorful lightball. Drum party: Drummers make music as others dance the night away. Social festivals: The leader gives a speech and then people gather to drink and socialize. Tree celebration: A social festival around a decorated tree. Burn circle: A moral leader gives a condemnatory speech, and the people burn a hated symbol like an effigy or flag. Smoke circle: People burn a special giant bong or incense shrine and inhale the smoke together. Skylantern festival: People build and release beautiful wooden lanterns that float into the sky. Gladiator duel: Slaves or prisoners fight in a ring to entertain spectators. You can supply weapons and they will be used. If a fighter dies, the crowd will come away even more excited. Sacrifice: A moral leader kills an animal or prisoner before a crowd. Cannibal feast: Colonists gather to devour a scrumptious platter of human meat. Scarification: The moral guide inducts a new believer by aesthetically scarring them while others watch. Blinding: The moral guide inducts a new believer by blinding them while others watch. Funeral: People gather around a grave to remember someone they lost, while a moral guide gives a speech. Some rituals aren’t specific to belief systems: Leader speeches: The colony’s leader gives a rousing speech intended to boost morale. If their social skills fail, it might have the opposite effect! Trial: The leader accuses someone of heinous crimes. The accuser and accused argue the case in front of witnesses. If convicted, the accused can be punished without social consequences. Public execution: A killing of a prisoner. This goes best after a trial where the prisoner is found guilty of something. Tree connection: A majestic ceremony where a colonist connects with a Gauranlen tree, giving them the ability to command the dryads inside. Gauranlen trees A unique type of tree called the Gauranlen tree will occasionally sprout near your colony. These majestic orange trees have a symbiotic relationship with small creatures called dryads. The tree supports the dryads, and in return the dryads protect the tree. Each tree has a few dryads attached to it. A colonist can connect with a tree in a special ceremony. By pruning the tree over time, the colonist can strengthen the connection and gain the ability to influence its dryads. Under your influence, dryads can specialize into different castes: Carrier : These chunky helpers will haul things where they need to go. Clawer : Vulnerable but fearsome, the clawer specializes in damage dealing. Barkskin : Slow but tough, the barkskin soaks hits for your other fighters. Woodmaker : Generates wood over time. Medicinemaker : Generates herbal medicine over time. Berrymaker : Generates berries over time. Gaumaker : Produces Gauranlen sprouts to make new Gauranlen trees. Beliefs matter. If your colonists venerate the trees, they can connect with Gauranlen trees more effectively and influence the dryads more efficiently. Only those who truly respect the trees can control their reproduction. With time, such a tree-connector colony can build an economy and an army from its Gauranlen orchard and the cute, useful, fearsome dryads. Relic hunts Every belief system holds some special objects as relics. It might be an ancient sword, a skull, a piece of armor, or anything else. Embark on multi-part quests to find and collect the relics that you believe in. Hunting a relic involves several kinds of quests to find the relic: Ancient complex quests take you to long-forgotten ruins containing treasure and info about the relic. A wide variety of challenges may await you - cryptosleeping soldiers, insects, sleeping mechanoids, unstable fuel stores, or pirates who followed you to the site. Use these threats against each other to survive while taking what you want. Spacedrone quests begin with an spacedrone landing beside your colony. It contains info on a relic, but you’ll have to hack it first! Build defenses on the spot to protect yourself against other treasure hunters while you extract the info. Worshipped terminal quests involve an ancient terminal venerated by a tribal village. They will allow you to visit, but attempting to hack the terminal will cause the locals to attack. Consider launching an attack from outside the village, or enter peacefully and try for a smash-and-grab. It’s your choice. Once you’ve found the ancient temple that holds the relic, you can go there and grab it in a daring raid as you evade and defeat a variety of security systems. Take it home and install it in a reliquary. The relic will help you turn others to your beliefs, and also attract pilgrims who will bring gifts. Additional quests Ideology also adds some new quests not related to the relics. Ancient complex loot quests see you raiding loot-filled ancient complexes, either in a shuttle or by traveling in a caravan. These ancient complexes aren’t about finding a relic - just about getting rich. Complexes are procedurally-generated and contain a wide variety of threats. The threats are designed to interact with each other and even be useful - You can intentionally wake sleeping ancient soldiers to help fight pirates who followed you to the complex, or ignite an ancient fuel node to burn out giant insects nesting in the next room. It can get pretty crazy - this is RimWorld, after all. New temporary encampments will set up near your colony. These small communities are lightly-defended and often not associated with any larger faction, making them good targets if you want to become a raider yourself. Beliefs matter - If your beliefs are aggressive, your colonists may even demand this kind of attack be carried out regularly to satisfy their need for dominance. The encampments vary from farms to logging sites, mines, and hunting lodges, each with different kinds of defenders and loot. Groups of beggars will arrive and ask for aid. Help them, and they might reward you later. You can also choose to betray them and enslave them, recruit them, sell them, or anything else. Beliefs matter - if your beliefs are charitable, your colonists will be especially happy when you take care of the needy travelers. New buildings Belief systems unlock new buildings. Many of the buildings are used to support rituals. These include: Altar: Traditional platforms used in rituals. These are the center of your ritual hall. Ideogram: Arcane symbols on the floor that are used in rituals. Lectern: Give your rituals a formal look with this slanted stand. Having one nearby will extend the duration of certain rituals’ positive effects. Pew: Simple benches for listeners to sit on during a ritual. Kneel pillow: Cushions on which people kneel during rituals. Kneel sheet: Carpets where friends can kneel during rituals. Drum: Drummers can create music for rituals and parties. Light ball: It spins and changes colour! This ball really amps up your dance parties. Loudspeaker: Turn it up! Dance parties get more intense the more of these you add. Christmas tree: Its pretty lights and ornaments are essential for some merry festivals. Pyre: Create a tower of flame by igniting this log structure. Sacrificial flag: Think of your enemies and what you’ll do to them in this symbolic burning. Effigy: Set human-shaped sculptures on fire and watch them burn. Cannibal platter: Feed many hungry mouths with a gruesome feast of human flesh. Burnbong: Ignite for a cloud of smokeleaf that fills the room. Incense shrine: Light these incense containers for pleasant smoke to be released. Belief systems also unlock specific new buildables that have specific functions: Autobongs: Passively produce a cloud of smokeleaf for everyone around. Associated with drug worship. Dark lamps and dark torches: For those who shun the light, these provide gentle illumination. Slab beds: For those colonists whose beliefs eschew physical comfort, sleeping on these is noble. Sleep accelerators: Accelerate sleep at the cost of power and hunger. Transhumanists want these. Biosculpter pods: Reverse aging and heal scars. Essential for those who reject the weakness of flesh. Neural superchargers: Supercharge consciousness to speed up work. Transhumanists want these. Gibbet cages: Display the corpse of a defeated foe to strike fear into all who see. Aggressors desire these. Bonsai plant pots: Tree-worshippers can get their fix of trees even while indoors. Styles Each belief system is associated with different aesthetic styles. Styles affect how many things look - rituals, furniture, floors, apparel, and art. Your colonists will enjoy being around things that match the styles of their belief system, and some may reject styles of other beliefs. Styles include: Rustic: The homey country ranch look. Totemic: A tribal-inspired look. Spikecore: The spiky space pirate look. Morbid: Skull-and-death imagery for those dark cults. Techist: Technological motifs everywhere - circuits and hexes. Animalist: Animal motifs. Hindu: Descendant of ancient Hindu imagery. Christian: Descendant of ancient Christian imagery. Islamic: Descendant of ancient Islamic imagery. Buddhist: Descendant of ancient Buddhist imagery. One belief system can mix-and-match several of these together. Make the morbid pirates or techno-Buddhists you dream of. Styles affect apparel in many ways. Animalist believers may shape their recon armor helmets as terrifying animal faces. Morbid death-worshippers will use skull helmets. Spikecore pirates will wear dusters with spiked shoulders. There are many, many visual variations, so every colony will dress different. Styles also affect the artwork your colony produces. Statues will display the iconography of their creators’ belief systems. Some styles also come with specific floors including: Morbid tiles and carpets with horror skulls. Spikecore tiles and plates . Totemic tile and boards . Hex carpets and tiles for a techist look. Mindbend carpets for those seeking spirits in the smoke. Styles are also expressed in new decorative floor coverings: Spikecore floor stars for your gladiator arena. Rustic rugs for that farmhouse look. Morbid , totemic , and animalist slabs for those central points in the colony. New apparel Beyond styles, belief systems can make people want to wear specific items of apparel. Some of these can be specific to certain social roles as well - a priest or moral leader may need to wear a special hat or robe. Ideology includes a variety of new apparel items believers might want: Authority caps : Enhance the ability to suppress slaves. Tailcaps : For the outdoorsy look. Burkas : Full body cover. Flophats : Relaxed headwear. Slicecaps : High-tech headwear. Shadecones : Look good in the sun. Visage masks : Cover the face entirely. Torture crowns : Add pain, for those who want to suffer. Robes : For the solemn look. Headwraps and broadwraps : Traditional head coverings. Colonists also want new tattoos and beards and hairstyles related to their beliefs. They can visit a styling station to recolor garments using dyes harvested from the new tinctoria crop, change tattoos, or restyle their beard and hair. Slaves You can enslave prisoners or purchase slaves from traders. Slaves will work on most tasks like colonists, at the cost of reduced work speed. Every belief system has an attitude towards slavery - some find the practice abhorrent, while others accept and even demand slaves as part of their beliefs. You can arm your slaves and command them directly in combat. But watch out - slaves will rebel if they get the opportunity or they are not sufficiently suppressed. Your wardens can suppress slaves by periodically threatening them. You can use structures like terror statues and gibbet cages to passively suppress slaves. You can also make slaves wear special collars and body straps to keep them under control. Archonexus endgame As your colony grows wealthy, you’ll have the opportunity to sell the whole thing and start anew with your favorite colonists and animals. In return, you’ll receive a piece of a map that leads to the archonexus - a conduit through which an ancient machine superintelligence is said to affect the physical world. This quest acts like a partial game reset where you will start over with your selected colonists and animals. You can keep your favorite characters while moving to a new colony in a new place and progressing on an epic quest. Each new colony appears next to an ancient archotech structure of increasing psychic influence. Study each structure to unlock further pieces of the map. Unlock three pieces, and you can locate the archonexus itself, invoke its power, and transcend physical reality through the mind of the machine god. Enjoy the endgame credits to a new epic song by Alistair Lindsay. RimWorld - Royalty The Empire has arrived . Their refugee fleet settles the rimworld, and seeks allies. Their honor-bound culture wields hyper-advanced technology, while bowing to the ancient traditions of kings and queens. Colonists can complete quests to earn honor with the Empire. Honor brings Imperial titles like acolyte, knight, and baron. Build grand throne rooms for your noble as they rise through the royal ranks. Dress them in finery fit for a monarch, or the prestige armor of a great warrior. They'll make speeches from the throne, inspiring your people, and play piano, harp, and harpsichord. Each title allows you to choose or upgrade an Imperial permit: Imperial troopers, janissaries, and cataphracts drop in to fight for you in times of need. Orbital strikes and orbital salvoes blast your foes from above. Shuttles take you where you want to go. Labor teams help when you are shorthanded. There are multiple ways to develop psychic powers. Those who gain Imperial titles recive powers from the ceremonial Imperial bestower. Tribal colonists can commune with the mysterious anima tree to build their psychic link. Or, you can fight the Empire using stolen psychic technology acquired through quests. There are a wide variety of psychic powers. Some are made for combat: Skip , chaos skip , mass chaos skip , chunk skip , and wallraise move people and objects across distances to gain tactical advantage. Extract wounded allies, cross no man's land, pull enemies into melee brawls, shift cover where you want it. Painblock and focus modify the mind for combat. Blinding pulse and vertigo pulse blind your enemies or force them to vomit uncontrollably. Neuroquake overloads every conscious being on the map in a huge wave of psychic energy. Berserk , berserk pulse , and manhunter pulse drive people and animals momentarily insane. Invisibility prevents your colonist from being seen during stealth approaches or escapes. Burden and stun slow and halt your foes. Smokepop blocks line of sight. Farskip moves a group of your people across the world. Bullet shield creates a small temporary safe zone for attack or retreat. Flashstorm calls down a storm of lightning. Waterskip showers fires with extinguishing water. Beckon mind-controls foes into approaching you. Neural heat dump moves neural heat to an ally so you can keep casting. Others powers are useful for community management: Solar pinhole creates a long-lasting source of light and heat. Word of trust helps recruitment. Word of joy makes people happy. Word of love induces romantic attraction. Word of serenity ends mental breaks. Word of inspiration confers creative energy. Psychic powers require psychic meditation. Each colonist meditates differently, depending on their title, backstory, and traits: Titled colonists meditate on their thrones according to Imperial tradition. Tribal colonists meditate directly in nature, to the anima tree itself or to constructed shrines or ancient stones. Morbid colonists with psychopath, cannibal, or bloodlust traits meditate to graves. It's more effective when the grave has a related person in it. Ascetic colonists meditate to blank walls. Pyromaniac colonists meditate to flame shrines made of braziers, torches, and campfires. Everyone can also meditate to sculptures. This expansion adds a large variety of quest content. Since RimWorld is a story-generation game, quests aren't fixed like in other games. Instead, the system procedurally generates unique quests with every new game. Different goals, foes, guests, rewards, helpers, special threats, and world conditions combine to create endless varied stories and challenges. Quest givers may even provide special helpers during the quest - for example, a quest may ask you to fight a huge mechanoid cluster, but also include help from elite Imperial cataphracts to make the battle winnable. Quests will reward you with Imperial titles, new allies, unique implants, archotechnological artifacts, gear, faction goodwill, and more. Imperial hospitality quests ask the player to host a group of Imperials. The guests may be injured or healthy, useful allies or helpless burdens, single or numerous. They may be hunted by mercenaries, pirates, mechanoids, or more. You might need to get the guests to an escape shuttle under fire. Refugee hospitality quests present a group of impoverished travelers asking for help. There are many outcomes. They may reward you later for your help, or betray you in the middle of the night. A third party may make you an offer to betray them. If you treat them well, they may spontaneously offer to join you. Since they have no faction, you can treat them with kindness or brutality. Animal hospitality quests see you caring for a group of animals struck with sickness or hunted by enemies. Prisoner hospitality quests ask you to keep prisoners under guard. Shuttle crash quests begin with a shuttle crashlanded near your colony, under attack by enemies. Quickly assemble a defense around the shuttle and help its defenders drive off the attackers while keeping the civilians safe, until the rescue shuttle extracts them. Monument quests ask the player to build a grand monument, and sometimes, to protect it from attacks. Aerial assault quests have you supply troops for an ally's airborne assault against a rival faction. A shuttle takes your troops into combat and extracts them. Colonist lending quests ask you to send some of your colonists to help an ally, leaving you to run the colony shorthanded. Mechanoid cluster quests threaten you with a mechanoid cluster at your colony, or at a site nearby, in exchange for a reward. Other quests quests present special combinations of raids, animal attacks, insect infestations, atmospheric effects, weather, and more, in exchange for rewards. A new endgame quest comes after you have climbed the ranks of Imperial nobility. Host the Imperial High Stellarch and his elite Stellic Guards in your luxurious court, protect them from their enemies, and be invited to leave the rimworld as an honored Imperial guest. Mechanoids can now create mechanoid clusters - groups of new mechanoid buildings which work together to present a unique tactical challenge. Mech clusters always appear in an initially dormant state. The player can take the time to decide and execute a plan of attack. This puts the player on the offensive, which contrasts with the defense-oriented fights in the base game. Mech cluster elements include: World condition makers that poison the air, darken the sky, or create some other world condition. Shields to block bullets or mortar fire Factories to assemble new mechanoids over time. Beacons to call reinforcements. Turrets, mortars, and surrounding walls . Unstable power units which you can attack to create explosions, or steal. Alarm systems of various types. Mechanoid defenders including the new Pikeman sniper mech. Gloomlight units provide an extra reward if you eliminate the cluster with precision. Each mech cluster generates with a unique layout, presenting a unique tactical puzzle. Some of them will require a frontal assault. Others may be susceptible to mortar bombardment. You may be able to plant explosives inside the cluster before waking it up. A few can be defeated with a key sniper shot to a critical structure. There are many other tactics. Mech clusters can even be used to your advantage if you can lure foes or undesired allies into them. This expansion adds a ton of new gear. Some of them are unlocked through new techprints , which are special technology items acquired by quests, trade, or theft. New combat equipment : Jump packs allow a user to fly across a battlefield. Plasma swords ignite targets. Zeushammers blast the target with an EMP pulse. Monoswords cut through almost any armor. Cataphract armor provides ultra-heavy protection. Locust armor is recon armor with an integrated jump pack. Grenadier armor is marine armor with a shoulder-mounted grenade launcher. Phoenix armor is heat-hardened heavy armor with an integrated flame launcher, for indoor flame combat. Broadshield packs deploy a local shield for tactical defense. Prestige armor comes in recon, marine, and cataphract forms. It displays status and enhances psycasting. Persona weapons are unique melee weapons with built-in personalities. Bonding to one is a lifelong commitment. Each one has individual personality traits that give it special powers and quirks: Kill thirst weapons demand blood. Kind or mad thoughts affect a user's mood. Jealous weapons don't like it when you use any weapon except themselves. Psychic sensitizers or foggers affect a user's psychic sensitivity. Kill-focused weapons give instant psychic focus when they kill. Kill-happy or kill-sorrow weapons give happy or sad thoughts when they kill. Painless weapons block the user's pain entirely. Fast mover weapons increase movement speed. Hungry weapons increase the user's hunger. Neural cooling and Psy-meditative weapons allow faster psycast use. Freewielder weapons don't bond and can be used by anyone. New body implants enhance a variety of aspects of anyone's physiology. Internal blades and poison teeth mean you always have a deadly melee attack. Drill arms and field hands improve mining and farming ability. Neurocalculators and learning assistants help with mental tasks. Gastro-analyzers make better cooks. Immunoenhancers , coagulators , and healing enhancers protect health. Skin hardening glands resist damage, but they're quite ugly. Detoxifier stomachs , reprocessor stomachs , and nuclear stomachs enhance digestion or remove the need for it. Circadian assistants and circadian half-cyclers reduce the need to sleep. Aesthetic enhancements make your colonists more popular. Love enhancers improve mood. This expansion includes a new full album worth of new music by Alistair Lindsay, composer of the original RimWorld soundtrack. There are 13 new tracks totaling 1:04:14 in length.

Here's what the developer wrote about it: ""Life is comfortable in the quasi-medieval city of Horghh. In fact it is so comfortable that a group of aging adventurers - having no monsters to slay, young people to rescue, or tree-stranded pets to fetch - decide to incorporate into a dungeon janitorial services company. After renting a run-down office-hovel on the shady side of town, the group accepts missions from a line of increasingly dangerous low-lifes. Our heros are hired by overlords, evil sorcerers, and underworld bosses to exterminate pests occupying old dungeons, haunted towers, and other future centers of world domination. While working for the daily mutton, group members battle alcohol addiction, low self esteem, non-existent self-confidence, and total loss of integrity. It is a grandiose battle of epic mental and psychological proportions, to which most players will relate. S.C.O.U.R.G.E. is a rogue-like game in the fine tradition of NetHack and Moria It sports a graphical front-end, similar to glHack or the Falcon's eye. I tried to design the 3D UI as a best of both worlds from old to new: It lets you rotate the view, zoom in/out, view special effects, etc. On the other hand I've always liked the old-school isometric games like Exult or Woodward. Features -Multi-level, random, scrolling dungeons. Populated with many, fearsome vermin for yer exterminatin' pleasure -Control a group of four ex-adventurers as they try to find dignity in their new profession -An interactive world of items, characters, spells, enemies and traps -Multiple missions per level, so you decide which dungeons to enter"" The whole game works in real time, but when you meet an opponent during a mission it automatically switches over to turn-based battle mode. Special about ""S.C.O.U.R.G.E."" is that it is quite non-linear. There are lots of missions you can accept and play, but most of them are not story relevant. So you can decide yourself if you like them and if you need to play another mission to level up before you go on with the story. The world of ""S.C.O.U.R.G.E."" is complex and there are lots of dungeons to explore as well as lots of different characters, classes, spells, weapons and other items to use. If you like that you will be entertained for many hours (once you get used to the controls which are a bit odd at first).",1422,,,"Archive BitTorrent,GZIP,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Mac OS X Disk Image,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,scourge_game,0.41,"index,nonoindex",438274293,,,software,,9,,,,"2015-01-26T09:35:54Z,2024-09-25T20:45:10Z",2015-01-26T09:35:54Z,,,,,,,"a href=""http://www.curlysworldoffreeware.com"" rel=""nofollow""","Windows games,Macintosh games,Linux games,Vintage computer games,Action games",S.C.O.U.R.G.E.,,,4,2007

Megaquarium follows in the footsteps of classic theme park management tycoon games and adds an aquatic spin! A living simulation Starting with just a few tanks and the most basic of livestock, you’ll grow your aquarium to a thronging metropolis filled with hundreds of guests, tens of staff and a multitude of different aquatic lifeforms, each with their own unique care requirements. Design your exhibits Megaquarium features almost 100 different marine species including fish, sharks, crustaceans, corals, jellyfish, other invertebrates and even a turtle! You’ll be spoilt for choice as you design, decorate and populate your tanks. The right staff for the job You won’t get far without the right staff. Choose who to hire based on their skills and future potential. Will you train up a team of multi-disciplined staff or a set of super-focussed experts? You’ll have to weigh up the pros and cons of each strategy and work out what is right for your aquarium. Research new animals and technology As guests experience your displays you’ll earn points which you can assign to discovering new livestock and equipment. Keep upgrading and expanding your aquarium and work your way up to the most prestigious animals and displays in the aquarium industry. Manage your finances The latest fish might look cool, but have you considered its impact on your aquarium’s bottom line. Tricky animals may require new staff to be hired, expensive fish food or supplements and the best tanks are a hefty investment! As aquarium curator you’ll need to master creativity and economics to succeed. Manage your guests! Keep your guests happy by providing them with seating, food, drinks and toilet facilities. Then at the end of their visit, direct them through the gift shop to boost your profits! Curator school Start your career in the campaign mode where you’ll learn everything you need to know about designing and managing an aquarium. Each of the 10 levels challenges you to build an aquarium with unique gameplay conditions and objectives, while new features and concepts are explained along the way. Dive into the sandbox Next explore sandbox mode where, with customisable settings and a random challenge generator, you can find virtually unlimited fish-related gameplay! Easy to learn, difficult to master Running an inefficient aquarium is easy. To really thrive and take on the greatest challenges you’ll need a lateral thinking brain and attention to detail. Will you group your animals by food type, water quality or something else entirely? Will you locate your equipment in a centralised hub using pumps or spread them out embracing the zoning system? How will you optimise your layout so that visitors can find your tanks and staff can easily access them? Every decision you make in Megaquarium has consequences. Your choice of animals, filters, tanks, staff and layout all have subtle and far reaching effects on each other. Experiment, adjust, learn, reapply and most importantly, have fun!

Songs of Syx is a fantasy city-builder where you start off as an insignificant colony and build, scheme, and fight your way towards a metropolis and empire. The mechanics are complex and true to life, where small events can spiral into the collapse of kingdoms. Easy to learn, but impossible to master. It's set in a low-fantasy world with graphics aimed at stimulating your imagination. Living World Full of different races, cultures, old and new gods and strange creatures. Night turns to day, climate and weather change, and migrations of animals and people flow. Droughts and pestilence, pirates and bandits, and new discoveries will ensure kingdoms and empires come and go with or without your intervention. No game will ever be the same, as all content, background stories, and easter-eggs are generated uniquely each iteration, while still sticking to a rich background story that you will unfold piece by piece. Base Building on a Huge Scale Take your settlement further that you ever have by winning the hearts of your subjects or by whipping them into submission. Have their number swell your insignificant colony into a metropolis of tens of thousands. Be careful not to overreach, as everything you build requires upkeep and a slight disruption of your production, or a dip in your standing, could quickly spiral out of control and your people will not hesitate to depose a thoughtless king. Grand Strategy As your capital grows, it must be sustained by the villages, towns, lumber camps, castles and ports that constitute your kingdom. But you're not alone in. Other kingdoms and despots are eager to forge an alliance or expand their borders, so tend to your relations and try not to stand out culturally. To grow your might, you must engage in global trade, where there are no fixed prices, no currency to mint, but based on supply and demand, turning you rich one day, and your goods worthless on the next, if you're not paying attention. Massive Tactical Battles Gather forces from allies and vassals and conscript traveling mercenaries and heroes to bolster your ranks with up to 20k individual units. Use tactics and skill to encircle your enemy, or let your reputation demoralize them before clashes of up to 40k units, which outcomes dictate the rise and fall of empires. Nobility & Slaves Break the backs of slaves as they make your beds and swab your floors. Just throw them a bone from time to time to keep them from rising up in revolt. Appoint nobles, or import them from other kingdoms and have them manage different aspects of your kingdom to boosts your production and standing, but be careful with whom to trust, and reward them accordingly as some might get the idea to usurp you or join your enemies. Matching Soundtrack Thanks to the fulfilment of our first Kickstarter stretchgoal the game will have a fully fledged soundtrack made by @jasinkamusic . We already have some tracks done which neatly fit into the playable prototype. Explore the lives and personalities of your subjects as you build the basic necessities to survive your first winter. Hunt and forage and farm to keep them fed and weave clothes to keep them warm. The people that makes up your settlement come in many different races, with their own skills and flaws. Each one is an individual, with its own personality, agenda, preferences, friends and traits. You don't control them directly, you rather make the plans and they execute intelligently. If you take good care of them, more will immigrate to your settlement. If you wrong them, they might serve you inefficiently, or openly rebel against you. Take your settlement further that you ever have before by winning the hearts of your subjects or by whipping them into submission. Build cities with up to 30k individuals . As your numbers swell, you will stop focusing on the individuals and turn your attention towards groups. A group can be described as a combination of race, social standing, religion and trade. And in Songs of Syx, subjects don't like those who are different from them. It is up to you if you want to encourage such behavior by discriminating some groups and imposing privileges on another, or if you want to create a diverse and tolerant society, utilizing the different traits of races. Call your banners and swell your ranks with mercenaries and boost the morale of your soldiers with a hero or two. Enjoy massive battles , that aim to be realistic with low kill rate and fragile morale, as you fend off an invader, or reclaim a kingdom that is rightfully yours. Your city might get raided by bandits. Raiders wants your goods, and if you don't surrender them they will attack. As you grow, battles will mostly take place outside of cities and out on the field. And the battle matters. It will take years to build up a force and if you're defeated, the enemy will hunt down those fleeing and annihilate your army, while suffering minor casualties themselves. You will then have to sue for a costly peace, unless you have enough manpower and funds to quickly raise another. Syx is a living world, full of different races, cultures, old and new gods and strange creatures. Night turns to day, climate and weather change, and migrations of animals and people are on the move. Droughts and pestilence, pirates and bandits, and new discoveries will ensure kingdoms and empires come and go with or without your intervention. No game will ever be the same, as all content, background stories, and easter-eggs are generated uniquely each iteration, while still sticking to a rich background story that you will unfold piece by piece. The story goes that Syx and its races were once united under a mighty empire, overseen by the Gods of Order themselves. Harmony and peace ensued for many a centuries, as vast road networks and outposts connected the thriving cities. But one unfortunate day, a faction of greedy Men stumbled upon the prison of the God of Chaos and freed him on the promise of immortality. As the gods fought, the cities were erased and priceless artifacts and tomes of knowledge were lost. Outnumbered and desperate, the chaos lord unleashed a plague on the world, turning the dead into soldiers to refill his ranks, and used magical weapons of fire that layed waste to the remaining kingdoms and fortresses. Finally, all the avatars of the gods of order had been slain and thus banished from the physical realm. Failing to deliver his promise of immortality the god of chaos was assassinated by his fickle followers, and as he fell came with him ice and snow that covered the whole of Syx for an age. But, good news! The ice has now receded and the world is in dire need of your leadership. Play as the Dondorians, masterful miners with a will cut in stone. They spend their lives digging for Dyhrlium, fighting their arch enemies - the Amevias - and dreaming of rebuilding their legendary capital at Mt. Cerebus. They are mysteriously born fully grown, capable miners, and live long lives, preferably deep inside the mountains. Or play as Men, fragile and mortal, but equipped with free will and an ingenuity that has the potential to far surpass their Dondorian cousins. Unite their shattered and warring kingdoms under one banner, but beware of temptation that may lead you astray. And do hurry up, as there are whispers of the dark lord of chaos' return! After the war of the gods, the few Kantors that remained withdrew from the world to spend their remaining millennia in the frozen north. They are filled with wrath and disgust for men and their treasonous nature and generally stay clear of civilization, but if you're lucky you might be able to attract a few to your city, where they will be of tremendous worth. Here is some feedback from our prototype players; ""So I've been playing it for about 2 hours and holy crap... It's really good... Like... Really good."" ""I have like 0-2 games every couple of years that check all my marks. Games that I will love and play."" ""I wasted an inordinate amount of time on your demo due to how good and compelling it already was and I can only wish you the very best."" ""I was initially put off a bit by the UX/UI but pushed past the first 15 minutes of the tutorial. Once I got the hang of it and restarted I, without realizing it, spent the next 3 hours playing... so good job."" ""Not too many games can suck me in like that."" ""This is one of the coolest projects I have seen in a long time... I downloaded it yesterday and already have 4 hours in... its amazing!!!"" All of this will not happen over night. Currently, the base game contains 60-70% of the features , but these haven't been fleshed out and everything is unpolished. The game has been a prototype for 6 years and will be in EA for a long, long time, although the aim is that it will still be fun to play during these years. You are more than welcome to tag along for the ride, but only if you like what's already been created, feel enthusiastic about the vision and have money to spare in these difficult times. Until now, focus has been on adding and fleshing out the basic ingredients that makes a city builder. Ultimately, This game is a long term thing . In the near future we hope to implement empire management and nobility.

It is easy to learn (because of two tutorial campaigns), there a many maps and scenarios, lots of different units and buildings, a single player and a multiplayer mode, a very nice soundtrack and last but not least the game is available in many languages. Here's the description of the developers: ""In Widelands, you are the regent of a small tribe. You start out with nothing but your headquarters, a kind of castle in which all your resources are stored. In the course of the game, you will build an ever growing settlement. Every member of your tribe will do his or her part to produce more resources - wood, food, iron, gold and more - to further this growth. But you are not alone in the world, and you will meet other tribes sooner or later. Some of them may be friendly and trade with you. However, if you want to rule the world, you will have to train soldiers and fight. Widelands offers a unique style of play. For example, a system of roads plays the central role of your economy: all the goods that are harvested and processed by the tribe must be transported from one building to the next. This is done by carriers, and those carriers always walk along the roads. It is your job to lay out the roads as efficiently as possible. Another refreshing aspect of the game is the way you command your tribe. There is no need to tell every single one of your subjects what to do - that would be impossible, because there can be thousands of them! Instead, all you've got to do is order them to build a building somewhere, and the builders will come. Similarly, whenever you want to attack an enemy, just place an order to attack one of their barracks, and your soldiers will march to fight. You're really a ruler: You delegate in times of war and in times of peace! Widelands offers single-player mode with different campaigns; the campaigns all tell storys of tribes or Empires and their struggle in the Widelands universe! However, settling really starts when you unite with friends over the Internet or LAN to build up new empires together - or to crush each other in the dusts of war. Widelands also offers an Artifical Intelligence to challenge you."" But there are also some flaws (or maybe bugs). At least in the german version, the tasks in the tutorial campaigns stayed untranslated (in english). Also the game crashed once or twice after loading a map. And it would have been nice if there would be a possibility to rotate the buildings before building them, so the entrance could be at any side. It's a bit annoying that very often roads have to be build in a very complicated style instead of just turning the building around. Also it would be appreciated, if there were more campaigns. Everything else is fine and if they polish this game some more (most probably they will, as development/improvement is still in progress) it will be a real gem.",2721,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Mac OS X Disk Image,Metadata,PNG,Windows Executable",,Widelands,0.35,"index,nonoindex",373119032,,,software,,18,,,1,"2015-01-25T05:58:07Z,2024-09-25T19:48:48Z,2016-01-07T03:53:12Z",2015-01-25T05:58:07Z,,,2016-01-07T03:53:12Z,,,,"a href=""http://www.curlysworldoffreeware.com"" rel=""nofollow""","Windows games,Macintosh games,Linux games,Vintage computer games,Strategy games",Widelands,,,7,2007

On this page, you can download the archive of the game from GOG, which contains the corrected libraries. You can also download the original installer located in directory original_installer . Hotline Miami is a high-octane action game overflowing with raw brutality, hard-boiled gunplay and skull crushing close combat. Set in an alternative 1989 Miami, you will assume the role of a mysterious antihero on a murderous rampage against the shady underworld at the behest of voices on your answering machine. Soon you'll find yourself struggling to get a grip of what is going on and why you are prone to these acts of violence. Rely on your wits to choreograph your way through seemingly impossible situations as you constantly find yourself outnumbered by vicious enemies. The action is unrelenting and every shot is deadly so each move must be quick and decisive if you hope to survive and unveil the sinister forces driving the bloodshed. Hotline Miami’s unmistakable visual style, a driving soundtrack, and a surreal chain of events will have you question your own thirst for blood while pushing you to the limits with a brutally unforgiving challenge. Some tactical thinking required, if you don't want to die--often. A surreal and gritty storyline panned out over 20 ultra-violent multi-level maps. Breakneck gunplay in bloodstained neon corridors combined with an intense, pumping soundtrack. Gut-wrenching battles against a bizarre cast of bosses from Miami’s underground.

The enclave maintains no diplomatic relationship with the surrounding so-called 'Republic of Austria' or with the Fortress 'European Union'. The downfall of her motherland -- the Soviet Union -- in the early 1990s had a particularly bad effect on the country's economic situation. It is a great challenge to secure survival for the small but proud confederation. External reactionary forces put the country in danger. It's a lack of respect due to a morally corrupted and perhaps even non-existing unity of the peoples. The goal of a glorious future is almost unreachable. But there are a handful of people who don't give up on a vision for a better tomorrow. Let us tell you the stories of the brave citizens in the beautiful little country of Soviet Unterzögersdorf. The game has a very unique graphical style (using photos instead of drawn pictures), a fantastic soundtrack and professional russian voice acting (with english or german subtitles).

In CROSSNIQ+, the name of the game is re-arranging a grid of tiles to form ""crosses"" - rows and column of the same color. You can move tiles up, down, left or right - but moving them off the edge of the grid makes them wrap back to the other side, offering a unique and brain-bending challenge that's been compared to a mix between matching games and a color cube. Unlike other popular puzzle games, CROSSNIQ+ focuses on speed and technique rather than chains or combos - make crosses quickly and set up multi-crosses to earn bonuses. In Endless mode, keep making crosses to keep your timer filled - let it hit empty, and your game is over. In Time Attack, your time is a set amount - earn as many points as you can before the buzzer sounds.

UFO 50 is a collection of 50 single and multiplayer games from the creators of Spelunky, Downwell, and Catacomb Kids. Explore a variety of genres, from platformers and shoot 'em ups to puzzle games, roguelites, and RPGs. Our goal is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design. 50 BRAND NEW GAMES - These are NOT minigames or microgames! Although the size of each game varies, every one is a complete experience, from its opening title screen to its ending credits. Some are small arcade-style games but there are also larger open-world adventures and a JRPG that could take many hours to beat. AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE - According to the story of UFO 50, the games were all created by a fictional 80s video game company that was obscure but ahead of its time. Some games are sequels to other games in the collection and various characters appear in multiple titles as part of a shared continuity. AN INSTANT LIBRARY - All 50 games are available to play at the start! The concept was inspired by multicarts, retro collections, and the experience of going to a friend's house and perusing their game library. Jump in and out of games at a whim - exploring the collection is part of the fun! AUTHENTIC BUT ALSO MODERN - We carefully chose what elements to modernize. Every game shares a unique 32-color palette and we took great efforts to make them look and sound like actual 8-bit titles from the 80s. On the other hand, it was important to us that UFO 50 was fun and surprising for modern players, so we chose not to limit ourselves to the genres and design conventions of the past. VERSUS AND CO-OP PLAY - Half of the collection features local multiplayer, including co-op and versus. You can compete head-to-head in a new fighting or strategy game... or team up to beat a classic arcade game from an alternate timeline. It's great for groups! Here are some of games you'll get to play in UFO 50: CAMPANELLA 2 - The sequel to Campanella (another game in UFO 50), Campanella 2 features procedurally-generated levels where you can explore in your UFO but also hop out to enter shops and dangerous caves. You play as the intrepid treasure-hunter Isabell, but she hasn't always been a hero - by playing the entire collection you can learn more about her past. QUIBBLE RACE - In this unique sci-fi ""horse-racing"" game, the goal is to win more money than your opponents, but why stop at betting? Thanks to the seedy alien underworld, you can hire thugs to tamper with the race or even sponsor your own quibble to earn extra credits. But your opponents can do the same, so the question is... how well can you anticipate their actions? Up to 3 players can compete in this turn-based game of betting and bluffing. PINGOLF - A fan favorite at gaming get-togethers like PAX, Pingolf is another fun multiplayer game that mixes golf with pinball. As you navigate 18 holes filled with bumpers, trampolines, and other crazy obstacles, a dot matrix display will light up at the bottom of the screen to cheer you on! SEASIDE DRIVE - Sometimes you'll want a break from long, open-world games and challenging strategy titles, so why not jump into a straight-forward arcade-style action game like Seaside Drive? But even in a popular genre, UFO 50 brings something new to the table - in this case, Ojiro Fumoto (the creator of Downwell) designed a stylish car-based shoot 'em up where ""drifting"" across the screen is how you power-up your gun. GRIMSTONE - Yes, there is a full blown JRPG in the collection! Grimstone follows many conventions from 8-bit console RPGs, but is streamlined for a modern audience. Also, to make combat more engaging, we added a skill-based component to battles and encounters on the overworld can be strategically avoided. The story takes place in the American Wild West, where somehow the land has been swallowed up by Hell! Creating your party from the ashes of a burned-down saloon, you'll be looking for answers as to why it happened. And that's just five games! Out of 50! So come join us and enjoy this collection of 8-bit classics from another dimension! There's something for everyone!

This game is credited as being the first Real Time Strategy Shooter (RTSS). It takes place in the distant future when humankind has rebuilt society following an apocalypse, but is threatened by intelligent beasts. The game was released in 2003, and was turned freeware in September 1, 2006. Savage is a solely online game, as it does not include a single-player mode. Each match of Savage takes place on a map of varying size. A single match has two or more teams which form a combination of the beast and human races (the default configuration is one human team and one beast team). The goal of the game is to destroy the primary enemy structure - the ""Stronghold"" for the human race, or the ""Lair"" for the beast race. Each team has one commander, who plays the game like an RTS, and additional players, who play the game like an FPS. You can thus play this in one of two ways - either as a commander, which takes control of where troops should go, and battles be fought, and which buildings are being built. The other way is to play as a warrior/minion of this said commander. This gives you the option of following his leads which leads to the most success for your team, but might have you using a pickaxe, mining resources more than a battleaxe, harvesting scalps.",3574,,,"Archive BitTorrent,GZIP,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,Savage_The_Battle_for_Newerth,0.3,"index,nonoindex",320793101,,,software,,53,,,,"2015-01-29T17:55:43Z,2024-03-28T13:45:16Z",2015-01-29T17:55:43Z,,,,,,,"a href=""http://www.curlysworldoffreeware.com"" rel=""nofollow""","Windows games,Linux games,Vintage computer games,Strategy games",Savage: The Battle for Newerth,,,15,2006

Conquer. The infinite procedurally generated world of Necesse is full of mysteries to uncover as you grow your settlement and lead expeditions against pirate kings, dragons, and fallen wizards alike. Will you spend your days crawling through dungeons, searching for treasures and raw materials with which to craft your equipment? Or will you answer the call to adventure, traversing the seas and seeking out great foes to test your prowess? Recruit settlers with particular skills and work alongside them to mine a wide variety of ores, craft gear tailored to your preferred playstyle, and establish a flourishing village. Play singleplayer or co-op - or establish a dedicated server with hundreds of other players. The world is infinite and adapts to whatever mode you choose. Grow your settlement from humble beginnings, establishing orchards, farms, and workshops alike. Recruit settlers that can work your fields, tend to your animals, and acquire resources without needing your constant attention and supervision. Use their expertise to help prepare for your next expedition as they expand your settlement's capabilities. Hire guards and craft traps to defend against the many dangers of the world. Sell your wares and use your wealth to trade with neighboring settlements, acquiring much needed equipment well ahead of what would otherwise be possible. Whether playing alone or with a few friends, or even creating a dedicated server for hundreds of players, the world of Necesse and its threats adapt to provide a meaningful challenge. Explore freely or take on specific quests as you face off against unique monsters spread across a variety of biomes. Will you be a deadeye archer, a melee champion, or a master of the magical arts? Will you and your friends establish separate competing colonies, or will you pool your resources and divide roles to build a giant settlement together? When faced with a tough boss, will you team up to form a carefully balanced party with powerful synergies, or will you attempt to steal all the glory for yourself? Cut down trees, mine and process ores, pick herbs, and harvest the bodies of defeated monsters to craft everything from walls and furniture to armor, potions, scrolls, trinkets, and weapons. While some unique equipment can only be acquired by defeating special enemies, everything else can be crafted through a multitude of workshops to equip yourself, your visiting friends, and your loyal settlers. Unlock additional gear as you acquire new resources and discover countless ways to craft, build, and play – endless combinations of equipment means there's always something new to try. Play as you want, customizing difficulty and multiple gameplay rules to fit your preferences. If you don’t like raiders showing up at your settlement, turn them off, and fine-tune gameplay rules like the length of the day/night cycle or the difficulty of boss battles however you like. From pet parrots and penguins to genie lamps, ostrich mounts, and unique outfits, Necesse has countless options to explore. Whether you're playing singleplayer or with friends, and whether you’re cranking up the difficulty or taking it easy, each session is an opportunity to weave an epic tale unlike any that came before it.

They’ve spent a lot of time tinkering under the hood to take advantage of new technology and techniques. Bigger levels, hundreds of new colors, and morphing maps that transform mid-level are all just a few of the advancements made to the engine. Welcome to ION FURY! Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison earned her nickname as a bomb disposal expert for the Global Defense Force. When transhumanist cult mastermind Dr. Jadus Heskel unleashes a cybernetic army on Neo DC, Shelly decides it’s time to start chucking bombs rather than diffusing them. Her journey will leave trails of blood and gore in huge, multi-path levels filled with those famous colorful keycards and plenty of secrets and Easter Eggs to discover behind every corner. There’s also no regenerating health here, so stop taking cover and start running and gunning. Honestly, Ion Fury should probably come out on three hundred floppy disks. Shelly’s quest to take down Dr. Heskel’s army will see her use an arsenal of weapons, all with alternate fire modes or different ammo types. Her signature revolver, Loverboy, brings enemies pain and players pleasure with single shots, or Shelly can fan the hammer Old West style. Shotguns are fun, but tossing grenades down their barrels and firing explosive rounds is even better. Bowling Bombs are just as violent and over-the-top as one would hope. Ion Fury laughs at the idea of constant checkpoints and straight paths through shooting galleries. But just because this is a true old-school first-person shooter doesn’t mean there won’t be all the good new stuff the last two decades have brought. Headshots? Hell yeah. More physics and interactivity? You betcha. Widescreen, controller support, and Auto Saves? 3D Realms and Voidpoint took the best of both worlds and cooked it all into a bloody stew. The true successor to classic shooters such as Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior and Blood. Built using the original ""Build"" engine, with additional enhancements to further improve the technology. Beautiful hand-crafted artwork, built using original old-school tools and methodologies. 7 exciting Zones, each spanning multiple maps. Tons of enemies, weapons and carnage! Best of both worlds! ION FURY brings back the classic '90s FPS action you love, with modern additions such as physics and checkpoints. Classic level design, no procedural generation! Expect multiple paths, cool effects, and complex set pieces! True tracked module music! Incredible weapons with alternate firemodes! Easy access to development tools and modding on day one!

Build spaceships tile by tile, create optimal gas conditions, manage the needs and moods of their crew, encounter other space-faring groups, and explore the universe in this spaceship colony sim. Customize - Complete freedom to build a spaceship or station of your own desire. Place every piece of ship hull, wall, door and facility wherever you want. Functional - All facilities serve a purpose. Crew members will sleep in beds, use toilets, be disturbed by a noisy room and praise you for an arcade machine. A functional spaceship can be built tile-by tile, giving you the opportunity to shape a spaceship of your own desire. It can be symmetric and streamlined, or an asymmetrical whimsical looking thing. It does not have to look like a conventional spaceship depicted in sci-fi literature, you are free to design your own, the choice is yours!

The isometric tile-based gas system simulates various gases, temperature and crew comfort on your spaceship. Humans, plants and facilities react to the conditions surrounding them, giving meaning to how you design your ship and the living conditions you create. Secure facilities, optimize crew survival and well-being, but also think of possible future accidents and chaos generated from crew combat or environmental hazards. Skills and traits - Every crew member has their own set of skills and traits. A wimp might get scared shooting a gun, while an iron-stomach can eat anything unaffected. Mood - A happy crew member needs food, sleep, comfort, safety and friends. Take something away and their mood will be affected. Conditions - Crew members might feel adventurous, suffer from starvation, feel unhygienic, or they simply ate too much. Various conditions affect how they feel. Mental breaks - When the stress is too much for a crew member they may suffer a mental break. Some will vent themselves out of the air lock, while others might start a fight. In Space Haven characters aren't mere robots. The game simulates needs, moods, health and skills of your crew members and they develop relationships with each other. Their past life occupation and hobbies will affect their skills and know-how, and they have both positive and negative traits.

Away missions - Equip your crew members and organize away teams to explore derelict ships or visit stations or spaceships of other factions.

See your crew load turrets with projectiles, put out fires from explosions, patch hull breaches and repair vital facilities in the midst of battle. Tactical - Target the enemy ship engine and stop them from fleeing. See them do the same to you. Engage their turrets directly or try to focus on the enemy ship core and see their ship go pitch black. Build shields to protect your most vital segments of your ships. Build turrets and engage in tactical ship-to-ship combat, where a hit and explosion could cause a snowball effect of fire, smoke, hazardous gases and even hull breaches for either party. All crew members need to work together to win the battle. Cryopods - Protect your crew from side-effects of Inter-stellar travel. Place crew members into stasis to freeze the progression of a disease or to await rescue. Medical - Treat crew members for injuries, wounds and diseases.

Mix paint to create new colors, stack many layers of shapes and increase throughput as necessary. After all, it’s not an idle game!

Influenced by post-apocalyptic, horror, and cyberpunk classics but with a fresh personality of its own. Death Trash combines the crunch and depth of old-school, role-playing classics with the controls and game feel of modern games. Gameplay Death Trash is an open-world, singleplayer role-playing game with handcrafted levels, a strong story campaign and optional local co-op gameplay. The game features real-time gameplay with ranged and melee combat, stealth, multiple choice dialogue, an inventory of items and worms, a crafting system, and skills like pickpocketing and puking. Travel through a gritty, post-apocalyptic wasteland by world map and explore hand-painted, organic locations. Meet exciting characters, talk to the Fleshkraken, visit the Puke Bar, or descend into old temples in search of expanding your awareness. Customize your own character through stats and making in-game decisions. Experience the story and discover side quests. Fight against machines and larger-than-life monsters. Or become their friend. Death Trash features extensive player freedom: - manual save games - dialogue can be left anytime - kill everyone or... - don't kill anyone! Story Humans traveled to the stars and some of them settled on the planet Nexus with its ancient secrets of stone and flesh. But secrets were unearthed, and the civilized people had to flee into enclosed habitats. The wasteland is reigned now by outcasts, controlling machines, and offsprings of the worm. You are one of the outcasts, pushed outside with a dangerous burden to carry, and your path will take you through deserts, ruins, the underground, and beyond. Singleplayer / Multiplayer Details The main feature of Death Trash is the immersive single-player campaign. But the game also contains a local co-op mode: - Covering the full campaign.

Wallpapers, logos, icons and music are also included separately for easier access. The binaries weren't made available, neither were official instructions on how to run the game with Perl on Windows, let alone Mac OSX. A proper build wasn't released either, it seems development ceased entirely (at least with the main devs). This package was downloaded from the unofficial Facebook group for Frozen Bubble. The following blog post details on how to install the game manually in good detail: http://hrabbey.blogspot.com/2011/05/portable-frozen-bubble-on-microsoft.html Instructions 1. Extract the game files to a path that doesn't include a space (e.g. C:\frozen bubble won't work). 2. Start the game using the fb.bat file. Don't worry if the game takes a while to start, initially it has to create some files and can hang for a few minutes. 3. Using a program like IntegerScaler or Lossless Scaling is an option for running the game in fullscreen. Enjoy! The game's full-screen mode doesn't seem to work, at least on Windows 10. The graphics also artifact a bit in the game field, it's not that noticeable though. If the game still doesn't start, try running the game installed with no subfolders, as any spaces in the full game file path will prevent it starting. Excerpt from website: The game was developed by six developers and translated by many others:     Guillaume Cottenceau: design & programming;     Alexis Younes (Ayo73): graphics & website design;     Matthias Le Bidan (Matths): sound & music;     Kim and David Joham: level editor;     Amaury Amblard-Ladurantie: website coding & graphics support; Ported to Windows and Mac OSX by Kartik, Froggs and friends.",108,,,"Archive BitTorrent,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,Unknown,ZIP",,frozen-bubble-windows,0.21,"index,nonoindex,uncurated",225964127,eng,,software,,13,,,,"2024-07-13T07:26:47Z,2025-04-29T03:58:24Z",2024-07-13T07:26:47Z,,,,,,,"a href=""http://hrabbey.blogspot.com/2011/05/portable-frozen-bubble-on-microsoft.html"" rel=""ugc nofollow""","frozen bubble,frozenbubble,linux,linux games,games,windows",Frozen Bubble (Windows port),,,3,2002

Your city starts with three stations. Draw routes between these stations to connect them with subway lines. Commuters travel along your lines to get around the city as fast as they can. Each station can only hold a handful of waiting commuters so your subway network will need to be well-designed to avoid delays. The city is growing. More stations are opening, and commuters are appearing faster. The demands on your network are ever-increasing. You'll be constantly redesigning your lines to maximise efficiency. The new assets you earn every week will help immensely — as long as they're used wisely. Eventually your network will fail. Stations will open too quickly. Commuters will crowd the platforms. How long the city keeps moving is up to you. Key Features Compelling, constructive, hectic, relaxed gameplay. If that makes sense. It doesn't though, aye? You just gotta play it. Three game modes: Normal for quick scored games, Endless for stress-free sandbox play, and Extreme for the ultimate challenge. Build your metro exactly how you want to with the all-new Creative mode. Over two dozen real-world cities! Design subways for London, Paris, New York City, Osaka, Saint Petersburg, São Paulo, Istanbul, Auckland and many more! Each has a unique colour theme, set of obstacles, and pace. Random city growth, so each game plays out differently. A strategy that proved successful last game may not help you in the next. Each game's map is a work of art, built by you in the classic abstract subway style of Harry Beck. If you think it's a keeper, save it, tweet it, show it off, or make it your desktop background!

Although comparable to Earth2150® in many significant aspects, it does contain some that are unique. These include various radar technologies, a greater focus on artillery and counter-battery technologies, more frequent in-game cinematic updates as gameplay progress, as well as a different vehicle design method. It was released in 1999 for both PC and Playstation®. The Warzone 2100 Ressurrection Project aims to continue the vision of Pumpkin studios started in 1999 with the game Warzone 2100, Which was closed source until Dec 6, 2004 when it was let out the doors for the first time under a GPL license. Upon entering the game you land from your transport and establish your base. Here you conduct research, design and manufacture vehicles, build new structures and prepare your plans of global conquest. If the game goes badly you'll end up fighting last ditch battles here to defend your base from enemy attacks. Combat is frenetic, with extensive graphical effects and buildings giving rise to flying shrapnel and boulders. Within the game are many different structures and vehicles. From an initial Command Center, you then go on to build Resource Extractors to provide fuel for Power Generators, which in turn supply energy to Factories, Research Facilities and weapons emplacements to protect your base. Features: * 400+ Technologies to research * 2,000+ different units to design * 3 Large campaign maps to conquer * 24 Fast play mission maps for extra action * Intelligence Display sets objectives dynamically * Interactive message system * Fast Play Interface graphically Based * Quick Screen Navigation * Fast Find System for units & structures * Set Factories to constant production * Automatically send each factory's units to where you want them You can clearly see that ""Warzone 2100"" was a commercial product and it doesn't have to hide behind other classics in the RTS genre. Sounds, graphics and gameplay are top notch. There's single player and multi player mode and a campaign name that really deserves its name. After completing a mission you take all your progress like experienced units and constructed buildings over to the next level. So you better think twice how to build your base, because mistakes made in the beginning of the game won't be forgiven later on. Game is available for Windows, Linux and Mac. So there's no excuse for not playing this great game.",4935,,,"Abbyy GZ,Archive BitTorrent,Djvu XML,GZIP,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Mac OS X Disk Image,Metadata,PNG,Single Page Processed JP2 ZIP,Text PDF,Windows Executable",,Warzone_2100,0.17,"index,nonoindex",185670544,,,software,,82,,,,"2015-01-25T07:41:05Z,2024-09-25T20:43:38Z",2015-01-25T07:41:05Z,,,,,,,"a href=""http://www.curlysworldoffreeware.com"" rel=""nofollow""","Windows games,Macintosh games,Linux games,Vintage computer games,Strategy games",Warzone 2100,,,26,1999

The Doom part consists of monsters, weapons and objects familiar to Doom fans and original soundset. Additionally, there are plenty of level types and collectibles not found in original Doom. Game can be saved only when you are standing on stairs. Like in Doom, if you descend you cannot return to the previous level. There are 25 floors overall generated for single game, not counting secret ones. Note: First ""graphical"" version of DoomRL has been released on 28th February 2012. Apart from visual update and several bugfixes it introduces mouse support and features enhanced audio, but rules and gameplay mechanics remain the same.

Gaven, alongside his TechBlazer engineer, Javelin, fought against the Legion only to be forced into retreat after being gravely wounded. At a hidden laboratory on the outskirts of ARK’s Outer World, Javelin restores Jonas with a mysterious armor, formerly worn by an unknown GunBlazer soldier, which Javelin dubs: the RetroBlazer. Rendezvous with Javelin and the remaining GunBlazers to reclaim ARK City and defeat the Judgment! Gameplay RetroBlazer’s gameplay is fast. VERY fast. The controls are so precise and responsive, that you can fly through areas at ridiculous speeds. It’s simple, clean, and frantically awesome! Combine that speed and accuracy with intense combat, and a sprinkle of puzzle-solving, and you get an unique game experience unlike any other. Obstacles and enemies stand between you and victory. There are toxic water pits, lava, exploding barrels, and chasms of doom as terrain hazards. Enemies are everywhere, the obvious and not-so-obvious—shoot them all!

Mirrored from the Bay 12 Games website. Release notes for 0.47.05 (January 28, 2021): Here's an interim release - this is a fixer-upper for the old version, and not related at all to the new graphical stuff.  This isn't meant to address everything of course, or even most things, and we'll be cleaning up a lot more bugs and issues for the Premium release itself.  This one gets rid of some long-standing crashes and also attempts to address most of what we learned from the stress discussion from the forum.  There are still a few unmet needs (which don't contribute much to stress, but are an eyesore), and a few outstanding ideas related to winning sieges, ending wars and unattended children, but we'll need larger changes there that are better integrated with the Premium work. It's always a little weird splitting the bug fixes into the two major/minor categories, but especially here, where the stress changes add up to a lot, so the division below is particularly arbitrary on that score. Major bug fixes     (*) Fixed w.g. crash related to dark fortress civs having fixed positions not held by demons     (*) Fixed zero-size creature crash     (*) Fixed off-site werebirth crash     (*) Stopped visitors from siding against fort in any conflict where the fort's tame megabeasts are involved     (*) Made cave adaption negative effects less frequent     (*) Made people get used to seeing dead bodies     (*) Stopped corpse raising, shapeshifting and non-living non-vampire visitors     (*) Made basic friendships easier to form for slow-to-love people Other bug fixes/tweaks     (*) Made people that work outside a lot get used to bad weather     (*) Made valuable food satisfy good meal thought in addition to preferences     (*) Added some additional dwarf chat types to meet some other needs and reduce stress     (*) Stopped many minor thoughts from forming memories     (*) Removed stress from migrants (e.g. ones from old forts)     (*) Vengefulness is no longer stressful (as it was mainly related to defending others from attacking animals)     (*) Changed balance of migrant professions     (*) Patched one form of military item corruption on load (root cause not identified)     (*) Expulsion exception 'child not present' now only applies to minor children     (*) Fixed MUNDANE and HAS_ANY_CAN_SWIM for interactions/transformations",6535,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,DwarfFortress-0.47.05,0.14,"index,nonoindex",146219371,eng,,software,,102,,,,"2021-12-12T21:29:20Z,2024-08-24T20:15:03Z",2021-12-12T21:29:20Z,Bay 12 Games,,,Copyright (C) 2002-2021 by Tarn Adams,,,"a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"",table style=""border:1px solid #aaaaaa;padding:5px;background:#F4F4F4;"",tbody","Dwarf Fortress,Bay 12 Games,Tarn Adams,Toady One,Zach Adams,ThreeToe,simulation games,managemnt games,roguelike,mining,dwarves,Computer games,PC games,Windows games,Windows software,Linux games,Linux software,Mac games,Mac software,OS X",Dwarf Fortress v0.47.05,,,17,2021

Mirrored from the Bay 12 Games website. Release notes for 0.47.01 (January 29, 2020): Here is the villains release!  There are various bits we're going to have to loop back around to after the graphics work is complete (see previous lengthy dev log), so perhaps this should be called the first villains release, or more ""the guilds and temples and adventurer parties and pets release which also has artifact heists and extensive historical villainy, with lots of new mostly evil magical stuff"", ha ha.  We will get to the fortress plots beyond artifact heists when we return, as well as the ability for the adventurer to be a villain and to investigate them more effectively. The features are listed below.  For fortress mode, the most important new elements that will be commonly encountered are petitions for guildhalls and temples.  When enough believers or laboring dwarves are in the fort, you'll receive a petition, and it's up to you if you want to try to build the location for them or not.  To satisfy the temple petitions, you must assign a priest (the game will remind you with an announcement when your temple is ready for one, after a certain value threshold is crossed.)  The main benefits of guildhalls and priests currently is the ability of guild members to share knowledge, and of priests to give inspiring sermons and comfort stressed-out dwarves. Less commonly, but also important, a villain may target your fortress, especially when you get up to having artifacts they might covet.  If you notice an artifact has been stolen in a non-kobold way (the announcements will be different, make sure you have a sheriff to receive the reports), you will be able to interrogate anybody about the crime - witness reports might be useful with a name, or they might just indicate the artifact is missing.  Interrogation leads to a report indicator on the left, which you can read in the usual way (with 'r'.)  This also opens up the counterintelligence screen, which will keep track of information for you.  If you manage to interrogate the handler of any treacherous dwarf, generally on a return visit, you might even get the name of their master, if they have one, or get details of other plots throughout the world, though most of them cannot impact your fort directly (yet.) Dwarves have some more general relationship types now (especially the historical ones, who can arrive as war buddies or athletic rivals), and they can also have multiple lovers or get divorced or have children before they are married. Most aquifers in the fort are now slower filling.  You still have to act pretty quickly (this makes them remain useful for wells and other liquid matter), but it is very possible to just wall them off or otherwise deal with the water if you are ready.  You can still place a wall on top of shallow water.  If you want an old-style aquifer, just embark where there's a ""heavy aquifer."" Your fort may also be invaded by horrible things if the necromancers or demons have been entertaining themselves. The main new bit in adventure mode is right in the beginning - well, not quite.  Don't be fooled by the first character creation screen (which is unchanged), you'll get to the good stuff right after.  There are a lot of new options there (starting background, religion, starting site selection, equipment including quality, mounts/pets), including the option to make party members, who can be from different civilization.  Mounts greatly speed up travel if everybody has one (make sure the mount is their pet.)  If you forget a mount or meet with tragedy, you can claim a new mount generally from the pastures of human cities, or wherever tame animals can be found.  You do not have to purchase them currently.  Just press 'h' near one (the same key you use to mount and lead animals.)  If the wrong party member claims it, that party member can give it to the right one as a gift (a new conversation option which can be applied to anybody.)  Pack animals (including many mounts) can also carry items.  Press 'p' to place an item on a creature.  This can greatly increase your capacity to carry food or treasure.  If you claim a pet that is unnamed, you can name them as a conversation option (with the pet.) In adventure mode, if you have judge of intent, you'll be able to see the new readout of your conversation partner's mood/relationship with you (without that skill, you still get some basic info.)  You have the ability to interrogate people, using the persuade and intimidate skills, though this is limited now because we didn't get to most evidence.  People can confess to schemes, and sometimes that'll even be meaningful, but it's mostly a giant mush of data until we add more structure.  But it shouldn't be hard to find some even without proper story/evidence hooks - just go to a nearby castle in a human town, and some portion of the nobles and administrators there will be up to something.  But it'll be ultimately unsatisfying until we get to more.  As a small note, only confessions of schemes will show up in the new adv mode intrigue view currently (confessions of masters/handlers don't have a proper evidence link yet.)  Finally, there were a ton of existing conversation options and most are not linked to the new conversation variables (like confidence and agitation and how much they want to leave.)  But you should see them in action if you interrogate, argue about values, flatter, tell jokes or pacify.  Additionally, depending on personality, most people slowly loses patience with a conversation no matter what the subject is, unless they are kept entertained.  These ephemeral conversation values are reset every two hours, so don't worry if you lose a chance to speak to somebody at a given time. If you want to play with divination dice, you'll need to find a pedestal with some at a shrine.  About half of the shrines should have them, though a lot of the smaller road and intersection shrines won't have room and will just have statues.  Shrines labeled in text on the travel map have the best chance, since they are large.  Temples can also have them in the basement with the relics.  To roll dice, make sure they are in your hand and 'I'nteract with them.  Rolling should be an option there.  Once you do that, the roll announcement has a lot of information.  Statues generally give some idea as to whose shrine you are at.  Shrines can be both for organized religions or generally to a deity, and both types can have divination traditions. New stuff     (*) Guilds organize and petition for guildhalls, guild members can do skill demonstrations     (*) Members of organized religions can petition for temples and priesthood recognition, priests give sermons and comfort stressed dwarves     (*) Traitor dwarves, artifact heists, interrogation for crime from the justice screen, counterintelligence readout with organization charts     (*) Most aquifers are much slower filling     (*) Can start with a party in adventure mode     (*) Specify background and starting location and beliefs in adventure mode (most labor skills still meaningless)     (*) Can start with specified equipment and pets in adventure mode     (*) Tactical combat mode for adventurer party     (*) Adventurer can ride mounts, place items on pack animals, lead animals, claim pets, gift pets, and name pets (rider skill matters for melee/ranged rolls currently)     (*) Can pet animals in adventure mode     (*) Addition mood information in adventure mode conversations, (simple) interrogation options, flattery, joke-telling, calming remarks, (very simple) sermons     (*) Simple intrigue display with actors and charts discovered in interrogation in adventure mode (in 'Q')     (*) Divination shrines with dice and various effects     (*) Lots of new intermediate positions (mostly without new mechanics) in entities (chamberlains etc.)     (*) Alliances against world-ending threats in world generation     (*) Various villainous activity in world generation, in play off-site, and (more limited) in fort mode, world generation surveillance, interrogation and punishment.  Historical plots include theft, sabotage, abduction, assassination, coups, corrupt advancement promises, embezzlement, starting wars, and framing enemies.     (*) Romantic relationship changes (multiple lovers, affairs, children outside marriage, divorces, etc.) as well as other relationship changes and details (friendship/rival types, variables like trust, respect and loyalty)     (*) Merchant companies, military orders and mercenary companies, craft guilds in world generation     (*) Individual mercenaries and companies can upgrade their equipment, and richer world gen people can purchase houses and build up their own city towers     (*) Various religious interactions (shrine building, sermons, persecution) in world generation, lots of religious demographics tracking which influences shrine creation, religious sites and sermons influencing membership numbers, holy cities and a few levels of priest     (*) Various horrifying new necromancer/mummy/demon/vampire etc. matter - snow-balling zombie invasions, multiple experiment types, intelligent undead lieutenants with new powers, nightmarish summons, spreading evil zones, promises of immortality in villainous plots     (*) Dwarves can trigger dig-deep disasters in world generation, with repercussions coming to other sites, including fort mode     (*) Some new locations, some map details still in-progress, monasteries, private city towers, guildhalls, merchant counting houses, forts (bandits and mercenaries), castles have returned (basically unchanged), better necromancer towers and simple outlying buildings Major bug fixes     (*) Fixed visitor crash related to broken meetings     (*) Fixed crash related to broken crimes and travelers/sent-away dwarves Other bug fixes/tweaks     (*) Changed werecreature trigger condition     (*) Bogeyman limited to a few regions and given new powers     (*) Fixed error where bandit groups would be deleted prematurely in worldgen     (*) Fixed size issue with certain werecreatures     (*) Fixed bug where only last half of performance sentence was shown     (*) Fixed problem where biome and landmass names were sometimes split on the same biome/landmass",421,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,DwarfFortress-0.47.01,0.14,"index,nonoindex",146094625,eng,,software,,5,,,,"2021-12-12T21:17:45Z,2022-02-15T16:46:05Z",2021-12-12T21:17:45Z,Bay 12 Games,,,Copyright (C) 2002-2020 by Tarn Adams,,,"a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"",table style=""border:1px solid #aaaaaa;padding:5px;background:#F4F4F4;"",tbody","Dwarf Fortress,Bay 12 Games,Tarn Adams,Toady One,Zach Adams,ThreeToe,simulation games,managemnt games,roguelike,mining,dwarves,Computer games,PC games,Windows games,Windows software,Linux games,Linux software,Mac games,Mac software,OS X",Dwarf Fortress v0.47.01,,,1,2020

The main idea of RogueBox Adventures is to offer the player some kind of roguelike toy-world. This world can be explored at free will and even be changed. It is possible to chop down trees, gather plants or to dig trough the underground rock. The resources that are obtained on this way can be used to build structures (like buildings or whole settlements) or to craft new items like tools, weapons or furniture. Big structures allow peaceful villager NPCs to spawn inside them. Outdoor monsters like angry dryads, orcs and slimes wait for their chance to kill or to be taken by the player. To allow a easy access to the game for everyone RogueBox Adventures offers different game modes, may it be a sandbox-mode, where all monsters are peaceful, or a real roguelike-mode, where dying means to loose every progress made inside a game world. Furthermore RogueBox Adventures tries to use as less key bindings as possible, what allows to play it even with a gamepad if you like.

Release notes for 0.47.03 (February 16, 2020): Here's another bug-fix release, ranging into some older issues as well.  There's been some work on the raid crash/corruption problem, though I suspect that is ongoing - hopefully the frequency is lessened.  I've also done a few quick changes to socializing and stress, but that's a longer project as well.  Dwarves clump now in zones and taverns, which should help with the friendship rate, and I've made the most stressable dwarves a little more fixable.  One of the major causes of loyalty spirals/civil wars has been handled, and I did some work with hospital rest and diagnosis problems. Reminder:  We'll start coding on the graphical version in a few weeks.  We'll still have these bug-fix releases periodically, though there will be an initial gap of some time while I get the core framework done to the point where the artists can use it.  But there should be at least one more bug-fix release around the change of the month before that work begins. Major bug fixes     (*) Cleaned up equipment tracking issue for returning fort-mode raiders     (*) Made historical spies drop possibly divisive cover identities when arriving as regular fort citizens     (*) Stopped patients that have been in traction for a week from requiring diagnosis repeatedly     (*) Made dwarves inside hospitals return to rest if rest is cancelled     (*) Supported doctor's guildhall to fix broken petitions     (*) Fixed freeze related to forbidding doors/hatches     (*) Fixed crash related to starting modded fort mode critters with natural skills     (*) Stopped crash related to artifacts/books placed on adv pack animals     (*) Fixed crash related to deleting zones in adv mode site planning     (*) Fixed unretirement crash in adv mode     (*) Fixed bug causing you to become a different historical figure when unretiring     (*) Fixed w.g. crash related to imprisonment by civilizations that have lost their capitals Other bug fixes/tweaks     (*) Allowed placement of altars in fort mode (they have no specific function yet)     (*) Added person-seeking behavior to socialize activity and to jobless milling about in zones     (*) Changed stress calculation for high vulnerability personalities     (*) Made mummies control tombs more fully so allies couldn't call on zombies to fight themselves     (*) Stopped mercenaries from being hired to attack their own forts     (*) Fixed problem causing w.g. people to falsely befriend themselves for information     (*) Fixed xml log for entities acquiring buildings     (*) Fixed xml log for entities breaching the underworld",141,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,DwarfFortress-0.47.03,0.14,"index,nonoindex",146026640,eng,,software,,6,,,,"2021-12-12T21:22:48Z,2022-02-15T16:46:02Z",2021-12-12T21:22:48Z,Bay 12 Games,,,Copyright (C) 2002-2020 by Tarn Adams,,,"a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"",table style=""border:1px solid #aaaaaa;padding:5px;background:#F4F4F4;"",tbody","Dwarf Fortress,Bay 12 Games,Tarn Adams,Toady One,Zach Adams,ThreeToe,simulation games,managemnt games,roguelike,mining,dwarves,Computer games,PC games,Windows games,Windows software,Linux games,Linux software,Mac games,Mac software,OS X",Dwarf Fortress v0.47.03,,,1,2020

Mirrored from the Bay 12 Games website. Release notes for 0.44.06 (March 9, 2018): Here's the first substantial update to the fortress's world map screen.  New raid options are available, and it shouldn't be hard for you to antagonize your neighbors now if that's what you want to do.  Use the 'd'etails option when preparing the raid to set what sorts of actions you'd like your raiders to perform.  Skills and equipment matter, and skills can be improved during missions.  The skill of your best tactician is important (you'll see feedback in the mission report.)  If you demand tribute on an ongoing basis and the target site agrees to your demands, you'll receive something like a merchant caravan on an annual basis a few seasons after the initial demand.  They'll drop goods off at your depot and depart.  These goods can be carried off immediately for storage, but there's a new report so you can look at a complete list of what was delivered; the same is true of spoils from raids. A few notes on the bug fixes below:  the identity fixes won't stop bad feelings from existing conflicts in old saves.  Also in old saves, distracted animals might still appear to be broken at first, but they should sort themselves out after a bit. New stuff     (*) Can pillage and raze and demand tribute from other sites     (*) Dwarves on missions can now can gain skills     (*) Military tactics skill is now gained and matters in off-site battles Major bug fixes     (*) Fixed several problems causing the meeting queue to get gummed up     (*) Made monster-type critters and non-monster-type critters have proper hostile again     (*) Allowed people in the same squad to know each other's identities     (*) Made scribe copy job cancel properly to free up materials     (*) Fixed calculation of available writing materials in library Other bug fixes/tweaks     (*) Various speed tweaks     (*) Made clean job work inside and on outdoor constructions     (*) Made clean jobs continue to nearby tiles     (*) Made drunkenness make you less private instead of more private and fixed a typo there     (*) Made dwarven adventurers experience trances properly     (*) Made non-historical populations defend sites post w.g.     (*) Made off-site raid stealth success depend on site     (*) Fixed broken flags on merchant historical event     (*) Stopped dwarves being dragged to cages/chains from trying to clean the floor     (*) Stopped live generals from being elevated from zombie populations     (*) Stopped animals from developing need for alcohol after experiencing trauma     (*) Stopped unintelligent creatures associated to civilizations, like domestic animals, from worshipping gods when given historical status     (*) Stopped animals from revealing the location of artifacts to questers     (*) Stopped animals from forming grudges and other chat-based relationships     (*) Sped up legends loading in high-artifact worlds     (*) Stopped rooting around in the dirt from resetting path     (*) Fixed issue causing certain older army units from not appearing     (*) Fixed a few errors with abstract skill calculation for armies     (*) Reconciled bandit's map and in-play valuations of opponent strength to stop aborted ambushes     (*) Disallowed certain flying/swimming/visual/projectile/attack moves involving half-stairways     (*) Made branches/twigs burning over walls leave behind a floor properly",124,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,DwarfFortress-0.44.06,0.13,"index,nonoindex",139583102,eng,,software,,2,,,,"2021-12-12T21:06:53Z,2022-02-15T16:46:16Z",2021-12-12T21:06:53Z,Bay 12 Games,,,Copyright (C) 2002-2018 by Tarn Adams,,,"a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"",table style=""border:1px solid #aaaaaa;padding:5px;background:#F4F4F4;"",tbody","Dwarf Fortress,Bay 12 Games,Tarn Adams,Toady One,Zach Adams,ThreeToe,simulation games,managemnt games,roguelike,mining,dwarves,Computer games,PC games,Windows games,Windows software,Linux games,Linux software,Mac games,Mac software,OS X",Dwarf Fortress v0.44.06,,,0,2018

,,4bb969c285c9818f9af7945d288958d76d62bf54,,opensource_media,,,David Henningsson,2003-04-26T00:00:00Z,"Hello, I am FreeMediaKids!. I have decided to return to pre-App Store freeware games, picking one that I remember playing out of the hundreds my father installed on my and my siblings' computer when we were children. It is called The Blob Game . Created by Sweden's David Henningsson, it is a platform game where one must navigate a blob across maps featuring many, many hazards, most of which are spiky; loquacious flowers who offer advice for how to play the game or hints; keys that must be brought to keyholes for level completion; and a lot of jumping— a lot of it. It sounds like an average platformer then. That is largely right, although there is a mechanic where the blob's jump height is determined by how hard he lands immediately before he jumps, giving him an extra bounce. It does add a sense of novelty to the game, and the player jumps by pressing Z . The X button allows the player to charge forward and travel a great distance, useful for traversing wide stretches of land with the only drawback being that the player must wait to control the blob until two seconds have passed or he lands on the ground. The arrow keys are used to move, and Shift is pressed to move the camera in the direction the arrow keys are pressed. First-aid kits are dispersed across the maps and can be collected to replenish the blob's health one unit a piece (up to five). Get hurt when there are no health units left, and the player must restart the level. It is a fairly simple platformer, but you may like to test your skills and see whether you can bring the keys to the right places and make it out alive. This game was downloaded from diwic.se , which, surprisingly, out of all the games listed on caiman.us , is still online. This game is made for Linux, but there is an outdated version for Windows. However, VirusTotal says that I cannot upload it on the Archive, so the Linux versions will have to do for now. The Linux version comes in four Ubuntu packages: Trusty 14.04 , Raring 13.04 , Quantal 12.10 , and Precise 12.04 . FOSS fans will be pleased to know that the author has released this game under multiple licenses, all of which are copyleft-compatible. I know I am pleased. Video update 11/26/2023: Soon after this item's upload, I began to put together a video presenting the gameplay. I took a hiatus lasting half or so of November due to interest in other things and being busy, returning to finish and upload it today to get it off my computer. The video is the most ambitious I have ever crafted, which was all made with only one clip of gameplay footage, and involved using many filters and my own little animation (including at the end, oof!) in Shotcut , a video editing application. In that, it also required a great deal of improvisation, so some parts may have needed more editing, or perhaps there was too much editing. Again, this is my most ambitious video yet, designed for an obscure piece of freeware. What a waste of time, or hopefully not. I will definitely continue to make videos of gameplay for my other submissions, though for now they will be more game-focused and less improvised.

Release notes for 0.44.11 (June 23, 2018): There are now peaceful and not-so-peaceful ways of expanding your influence in the world.  Once a site becomes linked to you (through prosperity or by conquest; you'll see a message), you can send a messenger there to request workers, or send dwarves from the fort out to such sites (from v-p).  This only works on historical figures, so you might find you don't have off-site workers available at first, though some sites do have them.  This release should also improve the issues dwarves were having with negative thoughts, and they can also now experience permanent changes in their personalities and intellectual values due to events in their lives. Note: Insurrections were such a problem in sites that I had to turn them off for your fortress's holdings; we'll get back to that later.  It wasn't even the insurrections, really; the dwarves were bailing on the occupation immediately because they were afraid of insurrections.

Release notes for 0.44.10 (May 5, 2018): Here's our next effort, which should change the general situation regarding the (often inebriated) fortress dwarves and their lack of apparent stress.  Part of this involves a new system of memories, which we'll be improving as we go now.  You'll be able to see these in thought paragraphs as they are remembered, so don't worry if they aren't apparent at first.  There were also other problems with inebriation and overall stress balance; some of the latter will be ongoing, if we've overcorrected, as varied long-term forts are difficult to test, but we'll continue working with it. I've updated how the adventurer information log works.  It's hopefully a bit more useful for navigation now, when it comes to adventuring and reporting back what has happened.  Old saves might not have everything linked up at first.  Hearing rumors again and so forth should make the log start to work better for them.  You can also cross narrow rivers in travel now (the ones that are jumpable or near jumpable at a sprint.)  Uncrossable rivers will display with double lines in the travel view.

In a RTS game, the player has to combat his enemies while developing his war economy. Everything runs in real-time, as opposed to turn-based games where the player always has to wait for his turn. The trick is to balance the effort put into building his economy and building an army to defend and attack the enemies. Bos Wars has a dynamic rate based economy. Energy is produced by power plants and magma gets pumped from hot spots. Buildings and mobile units are also built at a continuous rate. Control of larger parts of the map creates the potential to increase your economy throughput. Holding key points like roads and passages allow for different strategies. It is possible to play against human opponents over LAN, internet, or against the computer. Bos Wars successfully runs under Linux, MS Windows, BSD, and Mac OS X. Bos Wars aims to create a completely original and fun open source RTS game."" Even if the maps are a bit too small (at least in the first few missions) and the speed of your units is a bit too slow (which is kind of annoying when you are searching the whole map for the last enemy left) this one isn't a bad game at all. There are lots of different units and buildings and you can use them for different actions and fighting strategies once you figure out what they can do (the tutorial doesn't always tell you). Graphics, sounds and animations are good too and there are well working single and multi-player modes. So if you like classic real time strategy games like ""Dune II"", ""Starcraft"" and ""Command & Conquer"" you should give ""Bos Wars"" a try. There are not so many freeware RTS out there and this one is definitely one of the better ones.",2696,,,"Archive BitTorrent,GZIP,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,Windows Executable",,Bos_Wars,0.12,"index,nonoindex",132573258,,,software,,24,,,1,"2015-01-25T07:25:33Z,2024-08-16T09:46:17Z,2016-01-07T04:36:34Z",2015-01-25T07:25:33Z,,,2016-01-07T04:36:34Z,,,,"a href=""http://www.curlysworldoffreeware.com"" rel=""nofollow""","Windows games,Linux games,Vintage computer games,Strategy games",Bos Wars,,,6,2007

From a house in the city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world, you have a different power to affect the way time behaves, and it is time's strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind, objects that are immune to being rewound, time that is tied to space, parallel realities, time dilation, and perhaps more. Braid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this game. Every puzzle shows you something new and interesting about the game world. Forgiving yet challenging gameplay: Braid is a 2-D platform game where you can never die and never lose. Despite this, Braid is challenging — but the challenge is about solving puzzles, rather than forcing you to replay tricky jumps. Rich puzzle environment: Travel through a series of worlds searching for puzzle pieces, then solving puzzles by manipulating time: rewinding, creating parallel universes, setting up pockets of dilated time. The gameplay feels fresh and new; the puzzles are meant to inspire new ways of thinking. Aesthetic design: A painterly art style and lush, organic soundtrack complement the unique gameplay. Nonlinear story: A nonlinear fiction links the various worlds and provides real-world metaphors for your time manipulations; in turn, your time manipulations are projections of the real-world themes into playful ""what-if"" universes where consequences can be explored. Nonlinear gameplay: The game doesn't force you to solve puzzles in order to proceed. If you can't figure something out, just play onward and return to that puzzle later. You can play on Linux!

But it's well done and it's ""Guitar Hero"" for free, so who am I to complain about that? When you play the game for the first time, you should start with the tutorial. It's quite funny and helps you to understand the basics of the game (in fact it's not so hard to understand). When you download the game three songs are included and at least one of them (""Mystery Men"") isn't very hard to learn. Anyway it's incredible how fast you'll get better when you just try the game for a few times. If you don't like the three songs that come with the game, you can visit one of several sites of the big fan community and download new ones. There are original songs and songs from professional bands (for example ""Paradise City"" from Guns'n Roses or ""One"" from Metallica). Not all of them have the same quality, but if you search for a while you'll find something that you'll like. One source for songs is Keyboards on Fire The graphics and the sound of ""Frets on Fire"" are fine and there are several options (language, keys, graphics) that you can change to make the game even more suitable for yourself. So after all this is a great game. I played it every single day since I downloaded it and I'm still not bored!

Every game is a unique challenge, with five different heroes, randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use. ShatteredPD is also updated every two or three months, so there's always something new. Each of ShatteredPD's five playable heroes has their own unique mechanics and gameplay style. Cut down foes as the durable Warrior or deadly Duelist, fry your enemies as the arcane Mage, or use terrain to your advantage as the stealthy Rogue or the markswoman Huntress! As you progress through the dungeon you'll earn points to spend on talents, choose a subclass, and gain powerful lategame abilities. You can turn the Duelist into a dual-wielding Champion, the Mage into a soul-sucking Warlock, the Huntress into a tanky Warden, or explore loads of other possibilities! ShatteredPD's dungeon is procedurally generated with random layouts, room types, items, traps, and enemies. In each game you'll find equipment and collect or craft consumable items to power you up or help you out in a pinch. There is a huge variety to what you might see from run to run and region to region. As you progress through the dungeon you'll find equipment that can be enchanted, upgraded, and augmented as you outfit your hero. Set foes ablaze with an enchanted weapon, wade through enemies with upgraded armor, or gain powerful damage, defensive, or utility benefits from one of the many wands, rings, or magical artifacts. The Dungeon is filled with enemies, traps, hazards, and bosses intent on ending your run! Battle hostile wildlife in the sewers and caves, mad thieves and guards in the prison, occult servants in the fallen dwarven city, and maybe something even worse further down... All these hazards can make the game quite tough, but don't be discouraged! You probably won't win on your first try, but there are many tricks and strategies to discover and learn on the path to getting your first win! Shattered Pixel Dungeon is an open source game based on the source code of Pixel Dungeon by Watabou (first released in late 2012). It started in 2014 as a project to rebalance Pixel Dungeon but has steadily grown into its own game over the last 8 years! Features Include: 5 Heroes, each with 2 subclasses, 3 endgame abilities, and over 25 talents. Over 250 items including equipment, consumables, and items crafted via alchemy. 5 dungeon regions, 26 floors, over 100 room types, and trillions of possible floor layouts. Over 60 enemy types, 30 traps, and 5 detailed bosses to test your skills. 9 optional challenges and over 100 achievements for completionists.

Mirrored from the Bay 12 Games website. This release did not have any Linux or 32-bit Mac versions. Release notes for 0.44.01 (November 22, 2017): This is the artifact release, featuring the ability to send your dwarves off to cause trouble in the world, improved kobold sites, cover identities, artifact questers, and a bit of artifact diplomacy. In fort mode, the 'c' screen which used to list civilizations still does that as a suboption, but its main purpose now is to show the world map and allow you to interact with it.  You can either raid a neighbor generally, or send off squads to recover specific artifacts or rescue particular people (in which case, the squads will still bring back other artifacts and prisoners, but focus on the goal.)  A squad questing after an artifact will seek out information if the first site doesn't work out, and this might take several months, so be prepared.  Squads can also be captured during raids, though typically someone will return to tell the tale.  When squads return, a report will become available; a yellow 'R' will appear over on the left margin, and pressing 'r' will let you see it.  Sometimes reports are quite lengthy as squads stumble from tavern to tavern; you can press enter to skip to the end of the path animation. There are some rough edges here!  Be sure not to send off your commander if you are planning to reorganize your military, as they are the only one with the power to assign new squads and cannot do so while off the map.  There was a last-minute hiccup with artifacts known to be held by people (rather than stored on sites); these fort-mode missions will be fruitless for the moment; the most common instance here is books authored by people that then hang on to them, so don't try to steal their books!  It says on the map screen when an artifact is held by somebody, so it should be easy to avoid.  Raids do not bring back non-artifacts or build skills; these issues may or may not be addressed in the short-term depending on difficulties that arise. The interactions with heroes and invading armies are more straightforward.  There will either be 'P'etitions or a diplomacy popup to handle. In adventure mode, you can assume a cover identity.  You do this from the 'k' conversation menu (if you are already talking to somebody, it'll be hidden in ""start new conversation"".)  If you choose to link your identity to a civilization, you'll be carrying that baggage with you, especially when you are being interrogated by goblin guards, so one should be prudent.  To turn off the identity, go back to the ""assume an identity"" menu and choose the 'x' ""no identity"" option.  You can also reuse existing identities from this menu. People in adventure mode that are seeking an artifact will list ""missing treasure"" among their troubles, and you can then inquire further. In order to name an object, use 'I' to interact with it, and it'll be one of the options for appropriate objects.  For example, you can give a name to your spear or waterskin, but not to the water or food you start with. There are also various adventure rough edges.  For instance, if you pick up and then immediately replace a museum piece in adventure mode, and then tell somebody about it, you'll get credit as a Treasure Hunter.  It'll be difficult to fix that without additional property information, etc.  It's also generally hard right now to find artifact quests, as most things are in their proper place and/or not subject to an outside claim.  We'll be working with this a bit as we generally work on stabilizing the release. Overall, many of the changes occurred under the hood, in preparation for the myth and magic release, but now the magic release will be able to incorporate artifacts of all kinds without additional delay, so hopefully it was time well spent. As usual, your old saves should work, but please back them up before diving into the new release!  It is quite likely that forts will fall into technical ruin as bugs come up and are handled at this early stage.  Old forts won't have object additions like the pedestals and display cases, but they should be able to send out raids from the 'c' screen. We will be focusing on the worst bugs (crashes etc.) at first, and then we'll broaden out into other bugs, old and new, and minor suggestions/usability improvements, as well as a general smoothing out of the new features.  We're still working on the design side of the first magic release, so we anticipate we'll be doing smaller releases for a while. New stuff     (*) Ability to send out squads to raid sites, rescuing prisoners and recovering artifacts     (*) Display cases and pedestals, museum zones, both in forts and other sites     (*) Can view the world map w/ rumors from fort mode     (*) Artifacts created during worldgen: dwarf moods, named heroic objects, holy relics, heirlooms     (*) New artifact events in play and worldgen: questers seek artifacts and ask for or steal them, invaders demand artifacts     (*) New historical events associated to the creation of artifacts (used in fort and worldgen)     (*) Agents used by civilizations to gather information, can assume cover identities     (*) Improved kobold site maps     (*) Goblin site denizens demand an identity instead of immediately attacking every stranger     (*) More modding control over pets and other animals     (*) Adventurer can assume a cover identity at will     (*) Adventurer can name their possessions     (*) New adventurer reputations related to artifacts     (*) New religious activity: monks, pilgrims and prophets     (*) Museums and other room types can be added to fort locations like taverns and libraries     (*) Various additional data in the XML export Major bug fixes     (*) Fixed weapon trap crash vs. item breakage     (*) Fixed bug preventing monster slayers from visiting those forts with monsters to slay     (*) Made animated skulls, hair and other bits easier to pulp     (*) Made idle and vermin-hunting dwarves come down from trees more successfully     (*) Made thirst/hunger and being pushed out of the way less likely to terminate dances Other bug fixes/tweaks     (*) Alphabetized broad stock screen categories     (*) Fixed problem with historical bodies not respecting wounds/processing     (*) Fixed bug causing religions to worship too many gods, with duplicates     (*) Made simple burrow beasts start in caves as possible     (*) Fixed broken historical collection linkage with beast attacks during festivals     (*) Fixed one instance of broken animal person greetings     (*) Stopped natural animals from w.g. rampaging through sites owned by entities at peace with wildlife     (*) Took age into account for w.g. fights vs. body size (e.g. proper dragon size)     (*) Stopped people from being enough to satisfy a need to see great beasts     (*) Made visitors less nervous about going to neutral locations",108,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,DwarfFortress-0.44.01,0.09,"index,nonoindex",100924287,eng,,software,,3,,,,"2021-12-12T20:54:54Z,2022-02-15T16:46:09Z",2021-12-12T20:54:54Z,Bay 12 Games,,,Copyright (C) 2002-2017 by Tarn Adams,,,"a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"",table style=""border:1px solid #aaaaaa;padding:5px;background:#F4F4F4;"",tbody","Dwarf Fortress,Bay 12 Games,Tarn Adams,Toady One,Zach Adams,ThreeToe,simulation games,managemnt games,roguelike,mining,dwarves,Computer games,PC games,Windows games,Windows software,Linux games,Linux software,Mac games,Mac software,OS X",Dwarf Fortress v0.44.01,,,3,2017

It lets you see how all the security devices in a level are wired up, and then you can just click and drag with the mouse to wire them differently. So you can connect a lightswitch to a trapdoor, then flick it when a guard walks across to make him fall through. Key Features Rewire levels to work however you want Trick guards into trapping themselves or shooting each other Throw yourself - and others - through plate glass windows Investigate a noir-inspired story of murder and espionage over 20 missions Choose what to tell your clients, including lying to trick them Choose your own playstyle: quick, quiet, non-violent, no living witnesses, or any combination Discover new solutions to levels that no-one else has thought of Buy specialist gadgets to suit how you want to play All story stuff is skippable Hardest puzzles are optional No bosses - everyone dies in one shot, including you You can play on Linux Games on Linux for FREE!",655,,,"7z,Archive BitTorrent,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,Unknown","Action,Indie,Strategy",gunpoint-linux_archive,0.09,"index,nonoindex",97566509,eng,,software,,57,,,,"2024-05-05T19:05:39Z,2024-05-05T19:19:47Z",2024-05-05T19:05:39Z,,,,,,,"h2 class=""bb_tag"",ul class=""bb_ul"",strong","Linux Games,GNU/Linux Games,LAYC (Linux Games Y@Ldysse Collection),Uploaded by Y@Ldysse,Gunpoint","Gunpoint [Linux, Built-In libs]",,,13,2013

It should be ""software"", and I am flagging my own post to bring it to your attention. See also this item , where the mediatype should be "" movies"". Hello, I am FreeMediaKids!. We are taking a break from commercial games and looking back at the world of free-and-open-source computer games. Tux Racer  was one of the many games my dad installed for my siblings' and my Windows ME computer that I remember playing in the early 2000s. It is unfortunate that that was the operating system of my first computer, but as long as I could play games on it, it made sense to my three-year-old mind. Anyway, the millions-of-times-downloaded game is about the famed Linux mascot, Tux the penguin, who slides down mountainsides for fast times as he swallows blue herring in his path and the slopes threaten to toss him in the air and slow him abruptly. The bottom line is that it is a good game, and it was good enough to see a commercial release in 2001 and even an arcade adaption . I am aware of uploads of Tux Racer  on the Archive, but this upload contains all the versions that have ever been released by Jasmin F. Patry on SourceForge.net . It also contains Mac ports referenced by the project at  tuxracer.sourceforge.net , courtesy of Macintosh Repository . One should never have to look elsewhere for any of the official files.

Mirrored from the Bay 12 Games website. Release notes for 0.42.01 (December 1, 2015): Here is the new version we've been working on all year!  The flow of fortress life is quite a bit different now -- specific breaks and parties have been replaced by taverns and performances and needs and inebriation.  You can designate a tavern, temple or library from a meeting area zone, bedroom or dining room using the new Assign Location option.  The location list ('l') will let you know what sort of furniture and items you need, and you can set tavern keepers, scribes and other occupations there as well.  You'll need to set up a drink stockpile and a chest for goblets in taverns for drink service to work properly, but dwarves can still drink without a tavern as before.  You can assign multiple rooms/zones to a single location.  There's a lot more -- see the feature list below. The bug fix list below is partial.  Large chunks of the game were changed, which has a way of making old bugs go away while bringing in new ones to take their place.  We'll be focusing on bugs old and new in subsequent releases, starting with crashing saves and moving down the list.  The next set of bug-fix releases will be measured on a scale of days and weeks rather than months, as usual. New stuff     (*) Ability to designate taverns, temples and libraries in the fortress     (*) Taverns and libraries also exist in adventure mode and world generation     (*) Tavern keepers can serve drinks in both modes, goblets can be used by dwarves to drink (in taverns or otherwise)     (*) Performances include stories, poetry, music and dance (you can view activity descriptions from the unit/job list)     (*) Art forms are randomly generated for each civilization     (*) Instruments are now all generated, instruments can be used in both modes     (*) Most instruments are constructed from multiple pieces using different materials     (*) Personalities and values lead to needs which can be met by various actions in both modes     (*) The fort has visitors, residency petitions and eventual citizenship, including non-dwarves     (*) Tavern visitors include mercenaries, monster slayers, bandits, diplomats and performers     (*) Can set details for clothing/armor jobs to make them for other races that can equip items     (*) Monster slayers can petition your fortress to go down and fight monsters once you discover the underground     (*) Performance troupes are active in world generation and into play, visiting the fort, can be formed in adventure mode     (*) New knowledge system divided into nine branches (though it has very few practical effects so far)     (*) Fortress scholars can advance knowledge, form master-apprentice relationships and write down their findings     (*) Fortress scribes can copy works in your library     (*) Scholars can visit your fortress libraries, bringing knowledge from around the world     (*) Devoted historical figures can visit your fortress temples     (*) Three forms of writing material: papyrus sheets, paper sheets and parchment sheets     (*) Papyrus sheets are made directly from the plant at the farmer's workshop     (*) Paper is made from pressed slurries (start at the quern/mill, then go to a screw press)     (*) Parchment is made from hide and milk of lime at the tanner's (bake quicklime at a kiln, then make milk of lime at an ashery)     (*) Sheets are used to make quires or with rollers to make scrolls -- these are then used for writing     (*) Quires can be bound into codices with bindings after they contain writing     (*) Dwarves read books in the library (they don't need to be scholars)     (*) Values can be passed in writing (both modes) and through adventure mode arguments (uses some conversation skills)     (*) Animal people are playable as adventurers, arrive as fort visitors and sometimes live in towns in (playable) populations     (*) Children play with toys now, and they can also play make believe, in both modes     (*) Personality can be customized/randomized in adventure mode, appearance can be randomized as well     (*) Temples can be defiled in both modes, dwarf temples can be assigned to particular gods     (*) Adventurer can rent rooms in inns     (*) Adventurers can compose new poems, music and dances     (*) Adventurers can write material down on empty quires or scrolls     (*) Alcohol causes inebriation, erratic behavior, unconsciousness, death     (*) Festivals occur in world generation, though we haven't gotten them out of there yet     (*) Dwarves will wear trinkets again Major bug fixes     (*) Fixed some army pathing issues     (*) Goblins have mounts again     (*) Fixed long-standing flow bug with unit occupancy     (*) Stopped some issues with brawls escalating to non-lethal Other bug fixes/tweaks     (*) Looking at reaction screen for redded-out reactions in workshop will indicate missing reagents now     (*) Fixed inversion problem with half of the child/parent conversation thoughts     (*) Lots of historical figures that weren't around from the beginning didn't have deities when they were supposed to     (*) Allowed site finder to look for 1x1 sites     (*) Human civilizations now have randomized values     (*) Added ability to set invasion wave cap size",125,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,DwarfFortress-0.42.01,0.06,"index,nonoindex",63505683,eng,,software,,2,,,,"2021-12-12T20:39:03Z,2022-02-15T16:46:14Z",2021-12-12T20:39:03Z,Bay 12 Games,,,Copyright (C) 2002-2015 by Tarn Adams,,,"a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"",table style=""border:1px solid #aaaaaa;padding:5px;background:#F4F4F4;"",tbody","Dwarf Fortress,Bay 12 Games,Tarn Adams,Toady One,Zach Adams,ThreeToe,simulation games,managemnt games,roguelike,mining,dwarves,Computer games,PC games,Windows games,Windows software,Linux games,Linux software,Mac games,Mac software,OS X",Dwarf Fortress v0.42.01,,,1,2015

Major bug fixes     (*) Fixed crash that could happen when refugee rumors were created     (*) Fixed crash from visiting former player fortress with adventurer if certain army is present     (*) Fixed crash related to surgery     (*) Fixed crash that happened when it considered certain units in play for succession     (*) Stopped a conversation crash from talking to mute creatures about their troubles     (*) Allowed flying/climbing wilderness critters to work their way off the map     (*) Fixed problem allow the player to become invisible among many units even when clearly visible     (*) Made running away in terror/fear respect only valid combat location information     (*) Made genuine retreat and alarm state more separate from each other (being alarmed was being equated with flight for morale)     (*) Stopped certain old conflicts from causing alarm     (*) Made people that are attacked briefly have some knowledge of attacker's position     (*) Stopped certain jobs from being able to teleport items and engage in other action-at-a-distance antics     (*) Stopped necromancer towers from doing various inappropriate townish things that lead to tower proliferation etc.     (*) Fixed some reclaim/unretire bugs involving unavailable seeds     (*) Adjusted projectile firing speed which became broken during wagon fix Other bug fixes/tweaks     (*) Adjusted emotional strain vs. willpower etc. calculation     (*) Made non-extra-sensory creatures also respect z coord of potential targets     (*) Fixed a pathing lag associated to mood dwarves not being able to get to their buildings     (*) Added stockpile option for cut stones     (*) Removed obsolete relieved/drafted thoughts     (*) Made extra-sensory creatures even less perturbable by critters sensed through layers of rock     (*) Stopped erroneous conflicts between certain hunting creatures     (*) Stopped shared/wrestled items from being used for block/parry     (*) Stopped creatures with multiple attacks like hydra from stacking attack modifiers incorrectly     (*) Made attacker always look at target upon initiating attack     (*) Ordered farm plot plant lists by seed availability/name     (*) Lowered cap for wrestle skill gain so it wouldn't be hit triple digits attacking large opponents     (*) Removed double entry of ""slabs"" from stocks screen     (*) Adjusted 'v' menu location for window height (so it wouldn't overwrite certain lists, etc.)     (*) Fixed a few typos causing double periods in personality paragraphs",49,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,DwarfFortress-0.40.10,0.05,"index,nonoindex",58742095,eng,,software,,2,,,,"2021-12-12T20:06:41Z,2022-02-15T16:46:08Z",2021-12-12T20:06:41Z,Bay 12 Games,,,Copyright (C) 2002-2014 by Tarn Adams,,,"a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"",table style=""border:1px solid #aaaaaa;padding:5px;background:#F4F4F4;"",tbody","Dwarf Fortress,Bay 12 Games,Tarn Adams,Toady One,Zach Adams,ThreeToe,simulation games,managemnt games,roguelike,mining,dwarves,Computer games,PC games,Windows games,Windows software,Linux games,Linux software,Mac games,Mac software,OS X",Dwarf Fortress v0.40.10,,,2,2014

Mirrored from the Bay 12 Games website. Release notes for 0.40.09 (August 17, 2014): The cleaning continues with this release!  Some notes on poles:  For no-pole, you'll need to handle glacier and tundra biomes in one way or another (wider temperature range, remove region requirements, etc.).  For instance, to make a valid no-pole large island, all I needed to do was widen the temperature max/min from 75/25 to 110/-10.  This made a few glaciers and tundras scattered around the world, and it also allowed a few tropical biomes to appear.  For no-pole, base temperatures of at least 85 make an environment tropical (worlds with poles continue to use latitude), though 75 works for certain biomes.  You should be able to input your own temperatures in the txt parameters now without the game applying a polar shift.  No-pole worlds do not yet experience any seasonal temperature variations, and worlds with two poles still have seasons at the same time of year on either side of the equator until that can be made less confusing. Major bug fixes     (*) Fixed problem causing domestic underground animals to be placed beyond their number (and then replaced at that new number)     (*) Made people not so eager to jump in on the side of their relatives and friends if the relative/friend is berserk/etc.     (*) Made creatures prefer to flee normally if possible (rather than jumping off cliffs etc.)     (*) Stopped liquid flows in confined spaces from sometimes making items disappear     (*) Made items that froze in ice reappear properly when ice melts     (*) Allowed dwarves interested in marriage to start relationships properly (Quietust)     (*) Removed some vestigial code stopping wagons from moving properly after move/attack speed split     (*) Fixed a wagon AI error that caused them to fail to unload sometimes     (*) Gave wagons the ability to go past each other in certain instances     (*) Made invaders not come back as ghosts     (*) Stopped non-historical dwarves from coming back as ghosts (put in fix for old saves that should lay them to rest soon after unpause)     (*) Stopped ghosts from being considered in regular sight code     (*) Fixed the defend burrow order     (*) Allowed items made from gem materials (including large gems) to be stored in finished goods pile     (*) Fixed broken logic that made trade good hauling require both trade good hauling and lever operation labors Other bug fixes/tweaks     (*) Fixed up quarry bush bag job vs. rock nuts     (*) Added appropriate announcements for some additional circumstances under which a fort dwarf could assume a civ-level position     (*) Added embark warning if civ is dead     (*) Added optional confirmation window after preparing embark (default: pops up if points remain)     (*) Printed job after name when following unit     (*) Marked dwarves as ""New Arrival"" on unit/job screen instead of ""No Job"" while they are new     (*) Added pole-setting parameters for world gen, allowed north+south pole and no-pole options     (*) Fixed an error causing nearby site maps to be offloaded too often     (*) Made hill dwarf sites put animals in pastures properly     (*) Made animals not placed in pasture/waste/yard get placed even if their preferred type isn't available     (*) Fixed some manual typos (Gorobay)     (*) Initialized strict pop cap to 220 if not present in d_init     (*) Made alerts without names show properly as ""Alert State #"" in squad mode     (*) Finished updating pineapple raws     (*) Made several export filenames use the format (region)-YYYYY-MM-DD-(etc)     (*) Added error for unrecognized CREATURE in entity raw",174,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,DwarfFortress-0.40.09,0.05,"index,nonoindex",58721717,eng,,software,,2,,,,"2021-12-12T19:56:25Z,2022-02-15T16:46:14Z",2021-12-12T19:56:25Z,Bay 12 Games,,,Copyright (C) 2002-2014 by Tarn Adams,,,"a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"",table style=""border:1px solid #aaaaaa;padding:5px;background:#F4F4F4;"",tbody","Dwarf Fortress,Bay 12 Games,Tarn Adams,Toady One,Zach Adams,ThreeToe,simulation games,managemnt games,roguelike,mining,dwarves,Computer games,PC games,Windows games,Windows software,Linux games,Linux software,Mac games,Mac software,OS X",Dwarf Fortress v0.40.09,,,1,2014

Major bug fixes     (*) Fixed several large slow-down culprits     (*) Stopped trees from growing through floors     (*) Fixed a problem causing the suspension of constructions (old saves with affected jobs will still need to restart them) (ag)     (*) Fixed a few problems with hospital code causing them to overstock item (ag)     (*) Fixed problem stopping underground fishing (UristDaVinci/Quietust)     (*) Made cultures that oppose intruders more lax when in places controlled by less wary groups (one cause of marketplace knifefights)     (*) Made adventure-mode ambushers somewhat more in tune with their task     (*) Made master soldiers stop reverting back to corresponding regular soldier type     (*) Fixed crash that could occur when looking at adventure log while traveling Other bug fixes/tweaks     (*) Stopped clearing professions upon achieving master soldier type     (*) Fixed the population cap     (*) Made it possible to detect plantings too late in the season again (Quietust)     (*) Stopped migrants from retaining certain adv/etc. flags harmful to their integration into the fort (making them 'hostile')  Note: those from old saves might take off articles of clothing and store them and other strange things, since the integration could not be made complete easily...     (*) Fixed problem with non-entity armies/travelers failing to evaluate nearby creatures properly     (*) Tried to improve prioritization for creatures trying to handle many targets, especially w/ extra senses (caused combat AI paralysis)     (*) Stopped fliers from wanting to jump (and sometimes colliding mid-air)     (*) Added some basic climbing skill to wg/etc. soldiers, esp. thieves     (*) Vermin can escape from non-artifact containers properly (Quietust)     (*) Caravans check weapon type properly for material selection (Quietust)     (*) Diplomats that wanted bodyguards should get them now (Quietust)     (*) Stopped aquarium check from turning off other vermin code (Quietust)     (*) Fixed crash that happened in the arena when doing v-p on a dwarf with a weapon     (*) Creature art value considered properly by civs now (Quietust)     (*) Fixed problem dividing out item milligrams in weapon velocities (UristDaVinci)     (*) Can now melt metal chests (Quietust)     (*) Handled a few problems causing extra/erroneous long patrol thoughts (Quietust)     (*) Made children get full list of default labors upon growing up and respected any existing skills     (*) Stopped migrant historical children from receiving labors     (*) Made underground populations properly respect layer size (the numbers can get very high, but blame the giant under-ocean caves in part)     (*) Stopped hyper-obese digesting dwarves from constantly recalculating insulation/mass data (ag)     (*) Fixed some problems causing certain jobs to check too many items (angavrilov/Quietust)     (*) Allowed egg-laying critters without baby/child state to have viable eggs     (*) Stopped listing dead non-fort animals/etc. as missing     (*) Fixed a rounding error with projectile calculations (Pirate Bob/UristDaVinci)     (*) Adjusted contact area/depth

proper key for viewing agreements in civ screen     (*) Stopped dwarves from swiping hospital goods from the caravan     (*) Made the game respect more circumstances whereby medical inventory items

Mirrored from the Bay 12 Games website. Release notes for 0.40.01 (July 7, 2014): Here is the world activation release!  Lots of processes from world generation -- birth, invasions, succession, site foundation, and so on -- now operate in the world after play has begun.  Getting all of that to work led to a meandering route through various pieces of the game, some of which are described below.  Aside from any bugginess, a lot of it will still feel rough and unfinished as things bump around. New stuff     (*) World activation!  There are a few things that aren't active, like megabeast invasions, but lots of world gen actions made it into the game.  Birth, death (to the extent it wasn't handled before), marriages, site foundation as well as reclaims, basic succession and appointments/etc., invasions, as well as some more detail beyond world gen, like patrols, banditry and animal population handling.  We still don't have army battles -- the invasions are all successful right now, unless they are locally interfered with by you.     (*) The game advances two weeks before each play -- the calendar there still moves slowly when there's a lot of action, as there is in larger worlds, but there are quite a few things I can do soon to speed that up.  Due to the speed of the calendar, new forts in particular also get just two weeks.  This'll probably cause some shenanigans with the caravan (or you'll just have to wait a year in an autumn fort for your first one) until we sort it out.     (*) Fortresses can be retired and unretired.  Losing is still fun but if it doesn't happen when you want, you can put it off for a while.  Retired forts can be conquered (much more easily than they would be if you still controlled them), so don't be surprised if you have to reclaim instead of being able to unretire sometimes.  You can reclaim forts that didn't make it through world generation.     (*) Site maps for dwarves, elves and goblins.  These are very basic, but they are there, anyway.     (*) Multi-tile trees and lots of new plants.  Fruit and flowers.  Leaves that fall in little clouds.  I had to put off dwarf mode tree harvesting, but we should get to that before long.     (*) Megabeasts/forgotten beasts can attack, destroy and then reside within world gen sites like dwarf fortresses.     (*) Various movement changes.  Climbing/jumping/sprinting in both modes, though invaders still require a line of site to use them.  Adventure mode has a stealth rewrite, and some elements of that are present in dwarf mode (it is generally easier to spot thieves and ambushers, and I'll probably need to make them smarter about finding cover).  Movement and combat are separate now.  Startled people climb up the walls of their homes a little too often.     (*) Tracking information in adventure mode.  You can pull up a little window and see tracks (capital K), and you can also have it describe the freshest track that isn't yours to more easily stay on a trail (alt K).  Tracks are also part of the regular look command.     (*) Different levels of conflict -- your opponents in adventure mode will be listed with the current status (non-lethal, lethal, no quarter, etc.).     (*) Combat moves take place over a period of time now, and you can do things like catching an opponent's attack -- you have to do that by targeting a grab at the offending part now (reactions used to have a menu, but that was before combat got more smeared out).  You can get information about what attacks your opponent is doing in the attack menu -- the quality of the information depends on your situational awareness skill.  You can add adjective modifiers to your attacks (quick/heavy/etc.) and you can perform more than one attack at a time for a significant penalty to its force.  It might make sense with two adamantine swords or something, twirling them about.     (*) Rumors of incidents can be spread, and the rumors need to be spread before you gain reputation (good or bad).  Killing all of the witnesses to an event will effectively remove it from play if you don't let them get off the screen.  People are a little psychic as it regards ongoing conflicts, so that they can make decisions non-stupidly.  Your liaison can share rumors with your fort, but I still need to set up the screen for reviewing them after you've seen them the first time...  not that you can do much with the information.     (*) You can travel through tunnels.     (*) You can get a guide to travel with you to a faraway place -- it still ended up being too cumbersome, so locals continue to be able to tell you the location of sites, but only within a certain distance of their home town.     (*) In general, conversations have been redone.  They no longer have their own screen, but run along with other actions, and there are many more options.     (*) The mind has been rewritten quite a bit -- people now experience emotions according to different circumstances (lots of awkward monologues there), and they consider actions differently.  The main outstanding issue is that I didn't get around to converting existing dwarf mode thoughts, so they sort of exist concurrently with the new emotions and that needs to be changed.  I'll get to that before job priorities (which was one of the main shorter-term reasons for the rewrite).  Some dwarves have life-long dreams and it is possible for them to recognize that they've accomplished the ones relating to skills and family.  They cannot yet realize their dreams of taking over the world.     (*) The paragraph at the beginning of adventure mode was marginally more useful, but that slipped a bit at the end as things were tweaked.  I think it'll still describe certain invasions and abductions, but it needs to be redone.     (*) Lots of new arena options -- not just the conflict state, but you can set the temperature etc. to all sorts of extremes.     (*) Some experiments with procedural items, though the new demon-type sites are still quite un-fun now.  The knowledge on the slab at the bottom can be used, but it is probably not worth the trouble.     (*) The stuff I forgot Bug fixes     (*) I'm sure several old bugs were ""fixed"" as large portions of the code was rewritten/removed, but I haven't tried to track exactly which ones.  Bug fixes will commence in earnest now, and everything will be handled over at the bug tracker http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/.",295,,,"Archive

Release notes for 0.40.04 (July 20, 2014): This is mainly another crash-fix release, though I was able to handle some other problems as well.  I'm still hoping to get to optimizations (for the third time in these release notes!), but as usual that depends on stability.  As you'll note below, a few of the older bugs are gone -- as we continue in this process, I'll work fixes for old bugs into the mix. Major bug fixes     (*) Fixed a crash with pathing for jumps     (*) Fixed a crash related to invading squads attempting to train     (*) Fixed an overpopulation bug for civilized critters and a related one for site animals     (*) Fixed problem with retired fort uniform settings crashing later visits to the fort     (*) Stopped a crash associated to misplaced books/slabs (root cause remains, added some logs)     (*) Fixed position appointment issue that caused some instability     (*) Tried to make idle code somewhat better about climbing while still getting dwarves out from being stuck     (*) People with a weapon should use it with the proper frequency now Other bug fixes/tweaks     (*) Fixed problem with animal training/taming vs. lingering combat data (caused job cancel spam and inability to complete jobs)     (*) Stopped nearby objects from being teleported by construction removal and a related problem with the item loop (ag/Quietust)     (*) Made site finder properly indicate flux layers (Quietust)     (*) Made game better respect existing directory structure in data/save when creating new directories     (*) Made tops of walls appear properly when trees above walls are removed     (*) Made strangulation take less time     (*) Enhanced sapling survivability     (*) Fixed a problem that caused vermin to occasionally be generated out of the loaded area     (*) Fixed a problem that corrupted the information about items on the ground with temperature changes     (*) Fixed some brokenness with climbing AI vs. ledge tops     (*) Fixed a broken instance of chasing opponent AI vs unwalkable spaces     (*) Made climbing have a higher path cost     (*) Made people less likely to climb after a failure     (*) Babies don't start strapped with a knife",76,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,DwarfFortress-0.40.04,0.05,"index,nonoindex",58515952,eng,,software,,4,,,,"2021-12-12T19:48:34Z,2022-02-15T16:45:56Z",2021-12-12T19:48:34Z,Bay 12 Games,,,Copyright (C) 2002-2014 by Tarn Adams,,,"a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"",table style=""border:1px solid #aaaaaa;padding:5px;background:#F4F4F4;"",tbody","Dwarf Fortress,Bay 12 Games,Tarn Adams,Toady One,Zach Adams,ThreeToe,simulation games,managemnt games,roguelike,mining,dwarves,Computer games,PC games,Windows games,Windows software,Linux games,Linux software,Mac games,Mac software,OS X",Dwarf Fortress v0.40.04,,,1,2014

Major bug fixes     (*) Stopped autosave features from corrupting worlds (thanks to everybody that helped sort that out so quickly!)     (*) Made the game not crash when talking to a deity or shouting out in the wilderness     (*) Fixed a crash from trying to actively block in the adventure attack menu     (*) Fixed the size bug where 9 of 10 young critters did not grow up beyond baby size (thanks Urist Da Vinci and so many others for all the work on that!  I'd thank you all properly if I could do the archaeology to figure out how it was sorted out...)     (*) Fixed a crash that came sometimes when asking about the position of site forces     (*) Stopped a freeze that happened when swimming in deep water Other bug fixes/tweaks     (*) Fixed the tracking key in the SDL version so you should be able to do that with capital K now     (*) Added the short wait button to the adventurer manual -- you can use , instead of . to wait for one instant     (*) Made quarry bushes process to an edible leaf properly     (*) Typo when impersonating divine being",52,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,DwarfFortress-0.40.02,0.05,"index,nonoindex",58481780,eng,,software,,1,,,,"2021-12-12T19:46:38Z,2022-02-15T16:45:55Z",2021-12-12T19:46:38Z,Bay 12 Games,,,Copyright (C) 2002-2014 by Tarn Adams,,,"a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"",table style=""border:1px solid #aaaaaa;padding:5px;background:#F4F4F4;"",tbody","Dwarf Fortress,Bay 12 Games,Tarn Adams,Toady One,Zach Adams,ThreeToe,simulation games,managemnt games,roguelike,mining,dwarves,Computer games,PC games,Windows games,Windows software,Linux games,Linux software,Mac games,Mac software,OS X",Dwarf Fortress v0.40.02,,,1,2014

Release notes for 0.34.08 (May 14, 2012): Here is a hauling release.  I'm sure it has all kinds of interesting issues -- we're going to iron out problems for the next few releases without embarking on anything major in order to restabilize it.  The tile-wise physics causes some oddities on its own (items can't be given a meaningful sub-tile width, so they act a bit strangely if you look at the collisions closely).  Dwarves are also a bit enthusiastic with their new bin/barrel jobs -- when they grab a bin/barrel to load it up, it might have objects in it, and that might lead to conflicts/false shortages on occasion.  We'll have to continue playing around with it.  As far as I can tell, old saves load up fine and have usable minecart/wheelbarrows, so feel free to move your data/save folder over to the new version.  You'll notice your old save stone haulers moving slower -- get some wheelbarrows built at the carpenter's for your stone stockpiles to alleviate that problem. New stuff     (*) Minecarts can be used to haul things around on carved/constructed tracks/bridges ('h'auling to set up routes)     (*) Dwarves can be set to guide, push off, or ride carts that are ready to move to the next stop     (*) Track stops used to slow/stop cart and/or dump the contents on vehicle entry, can be disengaged with lever/plate     (*) Pressure plates can be triggered by carts     (*) Rollers can be used to push cart along when powered     (*) Minecarts limited to one per tile in general, various collisions can occur     (*) Wheelbarrows can be linked to stockpiles in order to move heavy objects (it'll auto-request one for stone stockpiles)     (*) Falling objects can collide with critters     (*) Camera can be attached to unit or item, can be linked to hotkeys from the unit/item screens Other bug fixes/tweaks     (*) Stockpiles can be linked to workshops, can be set to give to multiple piles, can be set to accept items from links only     (*) Hauling jobs will often be combined, using one container     (*) Heavy items harder to haul     (*) Densities/colors updated, based on Uristocrat's data collection thread     (*) Can filter creature names in arena     (*) Mine drop rates tweaked, no longer skill-based     (*) Puzzleboxes/drum makeable     (*) Stopped blinking on bridges     (*) Projectiles using new code (most non-shot/thrown projectiles) can skip/skid on liquid/ground     (*) All flying units use new minecart parabolic flight paths     (*) Many projectiles do not resolve in adventure mode before your turn (so you can dodge a flying cart by moving away)     (*) Can create/assign to squads from v-p     (*) Squads can be given nicknames from v-p or the military screen     (*) Fixed broken clay stockpile option",113,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,DwarfFortress-0.34.08,0.05,"index,nonoindex",53256488,eng,,software,,1,,,,"2021-12-12T12:19:58Z,2022-02-15T16:45:53Z",2021-12-12T12:19:58Z,Bay 12 Games,,,Copyright (C) 2002-2012 by Tarn Adams,,,"a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"",table style=""border:1px solid #aaaaaa;padding:5px;background:#F4F4F4;"",tbody","Dwarf Fortress,Bay 12 Games,Tarn Adams,Toady One,Zach Adams,ThreeToe,simulation games,managemnt games,roguelike,mining,dwarves,Computer games,PC games,Windows games,Windows software,Linux games,Linux software,Mac games,Mac software,OS X",Dwarf Fortress v0.34.08,,,1,2012

While you can setup the perfect chain it is much more likely that you will construct chains while blocks are still dropping around you. In addition to traditional game types like endless, time trial and stage clear the game does also feature a VS-mode. The VS mode is a dual like you rarely see in a puzzle game. The game is programmed by Poul Sander and is released under the GPL license version 2. Current version is 2.2.0 Features: Based on the classic “Tetris Attack” for the SNES Free as in “freedom” Free as in “free beer” No loot boxes 5 single player modes: Endless, Time Trial, Puzzle Mode, Stage Clear and Vs.

You must bring your Jumper at the end of levels filled with traps. Your skills will be sorely tested, and your only goal will be to finish the level the faster you can. The Gameplay is the main element of the game and differs slightly from other games. In most games, when you press a direction, it makes instantly move your character in that direction. If you release that direction your character stops. In  Battle Jump  directional keys are used to tilt your character, which will move according to this angle. Because releasing a key does not change the angle, the character will continue to the exact speed it was before you release the direction. Cover You will need to perfectly control your character in order to avoid falling into a hole or a trap. The game contains several levels with a progressive difficulty. If you think the first levels are too easy for you, don't worry, the last levels will be much complex. It is also possible to create your own levels with the editor, or to download dozens of levels made by the community. With its two-players mod in split screen, you can battle anyone in races where every mistake can be fatal.

Mirrored from the Bay 12 Games website. Release notes for 0.31.19 (February 16, 2011): This is the first release of what we once called the Caravan Arc, where we'll be changing how trade and the economy work.  The entire release schedule is up at http://bay12games.com/dwarves/dev.html.  This particular release doesn't have visible changes to trade -- just a lot of world generation infrastructure.  People eat and starve in world gen now, though it doesn't matter afterward.  Subsequent releases coming up will be making use of these changes during play, but don't expect too much there this time.  There have been many other changes.  Seeing most of them will require generating a new world. There are lots of new domestic animals.  We also added giraffes, rhinos, honey bees and bumblebees.  Bees were the winner of the animal sponsorship drive and they had many associated jobs, so we didn't try to get into the other sponsored beasts, but we'll be adding those in with every release. Animals can be placed in pen/pasture zones, and grazing animals will need to graze on grass (they can also eat underground fungus found in many open cave layers).  Pastures should be made large enough to provide ample grass and to prevent animals from being stacked on top of each other.  Animals crammed into one place for too long can become grumpy and violent, but the animals will stay in the pastures without much tending (a dwarf may occasionally run over to an animal if it wanders off the pasture border to walk around something).  There is no way to trade for hay or animal feed at this time, so don't expect grazing animals in new forts to survive on glaciers or the deepest deserts.  Many deserts have patches of grass (or succulents) now. Sheep, llamas and alpacas (and trolls for goblins) can be sheared and the wool can be spun into yarn.  Chickens and other birds will lay eggs in nest boxes if you place the boxes in accessible areas.  You can mill rocknuts into paste and press the paste for oil (which goes into jugs).  Pressing occurs at the new screw press building. You can make many of the more clayish soil types into earthenware ceramics now (and you can make fire clay into stoneware and kaolinite into porcelain).  If a fort embark location has clay above the aquifer (or any clay if there is no aquifer), it'll be displayed in the embark readout.  I didn't get very far into glazing, but you can ash glaze and tin glaze (with cassiterite).  Earthenware jugs need to be glazed to hold liquids.  Stoneware and porcelain jugs don't require glaze but can be glazed.  You can also make large pots out of various materials, and these act like barrels (they are associated to stockpiles in the same way, etc.). Honey bees can be collected and kept in artificial hives (which you can make out of various materials).  You'll need one natural hive on your embark location to get started, but after that you can split the colony into new artificial hives.  The process is fairly automated.  You just need to place the hive buildings and a beekeeper will do the rest.  You can adjust a few settings on each hive to control which hives are held for splitting and which are collected.  You'll need to have jugs around to collect honeycombs (the royal jelly holds up the process otherwise), and you'll need another jug to collect the honey.  Wax cakes can only be made into crafts by a wax worker at this time. The site finder records the best hit in each square now, and you can stop the finder at any time and browse the results.  The categories and readout have been changed up a bit.  Minerals have been redistributed on the world map, though this might not be satisfying as I was expecting to get a bit farther with dwarf mode trade.  Adjustments might have to be made there until trade is updated.  We'll see. Animals and plants occur with more or less contiguous ranges now, respecting biome.  There are specific grasses.  The evil grasses are probably a little extreme and seizure-inducing.  I might throttle that back. I'm starting the first one to two week bug fix cycle now, so there weren't a lot of bug fixes for this release, but creatures, items and vegetation don't pick up as many contaminants now. There are new options in the graphical map export from legends mode, and I fixed a bug there with village maps getting cut off.

Mirrored from the Bay 12 Games website. Release notes for 0.31.17 (November 11, 2010): If you want to try out the improvements to adventure mode, I'd recommend generating a new world with at least 100 years of history.  I tried out adventuring in a world from 0.31.03, and it technically worked, but there wasn't much to do.  The reason I recommend some history is just to let the beasts get settled a bit, though it's not strictly required.  We haven't gotten threats moving around and arising during actual play yet, so your worlds will inevitably run out of adventure opportunities as you exhaust them, and games tend to be fast-paced and brief overall once you get the hang of it.  This will change during the next few major releases.  There's an update to the ""Your First Adventurer"" manual section that might be worth glancing at even if you have played an adventurer before.  Don't be surprised if you die learning a few facts about the world. Major bug fixes     (*)fixed problem with baron not arriving due to stale merchant reports     (*)stopped old jobs/projectiles from tying up items on reclaim Other bug fixes/tweaks     (*)changed ring/bracelet symbol to make way for adv mode tools     (*)cut kill-bragging to 5 kills     (*)fixed bug through which demon could take over two or more civs in one year     (*)name change: graveyard -> corpses (since it isn't appropriate for final burial)     (*)stopped occupancy from being erased upon entering adv mode in arena     (*)allowed labors to be toggled by category     (*)added standing order for outdoor vermin refuse     (*)fixed erroneous material bonuses in world gen fights     (*)updated wrestling interface     (*)implemented text for wrestling attacks     (*)changed combat announcement colors and stun/paralyze color to light blue from light cyan     (*)toes/fingers protected by armor     (*)elves are now small e's to match their size     (*)different soldier/civilian symbols for human/elf (as with the two dwarf symbols)     (*)stopped triggerable vermin groups from becoming visible occasionally     (*)fixed some old problems where input wasn't registering properly on movement, etc.     (*)disabled need to eat/drink in adv mode until we get some more general work in     (*)various minor adv mode tweaks and fixes New stuff     (*)added night creatures     (*)added lairs for some creatures     (*)added new travel screen (old worlds might have misplaced moons in the sky bar)     (*)updated how adv mode sleep works, permission to sleep in buildings     (*)updated character generation     (*)added memorial slabs to dwarf mode     (*)added shops with signs to towns     (*)changed how lower body/head severs work (spinal sever required)     (*)changed how guts popping out works     (*)see file_changes.txt for some new modding tags     (*)can get tasks from most people and report success to anybody friendly     (*)added human castles     (*)made peasants refer you to better quests     (*)added banditry     (*)added aimed attacks, random combat opportunities and the ability to use secondary attacks/weapons (both adv mode and dwf mode combat reports)     (*)added (harder) rolling away for dodgers on the ground",85,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,DwarfFortress-0.31.17,0.04,"index,nonoindex",46793899,eng,,software,,7,,,,"2021-12-12T11:46:04Z,2022-02-15T16:45:56Z",2021-12-12T11:46:04Z,Bay 12 Games,,,Copyright (C) 2002-2010 by Tarn Adams,,,"a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"",table style=""border:1px solid #aaaaaa;padding:5px;background:#F4F4F4;"",tbody","Dwarf Fortress,Bay 12 Games,Tarn Adams,Toady One,Zach Adams,ThreeToe,simulation games,managemnt games,roguelike,mining,dwarves,Computer games,PC games,Windows games,Windows software,Linux games,Linux software,Mac games,Mac software,OS X",Dwarf Fortress v0.31.17,,,0,2010

Mirrored from the Bay 12 Games website. Release notes for 0.31.13 (September 15, 2010): The framework for villages and sprawl is in place, and there are now ""entity populations"" which are made up of thousands of critters for which less information is tracked.  As it stands, this amounts to, say, ten times the number of historical figures after world generation has been running for a while, though it can vary a lot.  These changes have left adventure mode gutted, so don't expect old adventure mode saves to retain much information or work all that well.  Old dwarf mode saves should be fine for continued dwarf fortresses.  In new worlds, you can wander around the new villages, but don't expect anything to be going on.  This is the launching pad for what should be the Funification of adventure mode in the next (non-fix) release, but like many launching pads, it is kind of dull and gray. As for the merits of this release, there are the bug fixes in the lists below.  The game should also be a bit faster.  I'm on a new compiler in Windows, which led to a general speed increase, and I also optimized some code for improvements on all OSs.  It's not the end of the story there by a long shot, but it is progress, anyway.  World generation itself might be a bit slower overall, since there's a lot more going on site-wise.  This is going to change as we set up relationships between the leaders, one way or another, but I can make a medium island world in around 10 minutes without the memory going totally nuts, and I thought that state was fit for release. There are some side effects to not having any stable relationships between world gen sites while cutting down on site destructions, like having a site get pillaged for the thousandth time and so on, which will iron themselves out later.  For now, it's a bit weird.  I also saw a battle with negative numbers of soldiers but couldn't reproduce the situation, so there are probably additional issues as well. The SDL version has the first pass at the experimental TrueType font support that Baughn is working on.  It is off by default in init.txt and it only works in the 2D print mode.  There are lots of justification etc. problems -- you don't need to report those.  Getting those fixed up is part of the process.  It's difficult to read in the standard window size, so you might want to limit yourself to full-screen or a large window with large grid cells when you are trying it out.

Mirrored from the Bay 12 Games website. Release notes for 0.31.14 (September 23, 2010): The main issues here were to handle the new bugs from 0.31.13 which were gumming things up (broken migration, undiggable adamantine) and to address site sprawl concerns a bit.  To the latter end, there's a new world gen option to limit the total number of sites and I've added a few options to ""Create World Now!"" to make use of that.  It's not going to be truly satisfying until dwarven sprawl is better defined and there are more things to do with the sprawl in adventure mode and in dwarf mode wars, but overall I don't plan to decrease the amount of sprawl drastically on default settings once that is handled -- sprawl will likely increase again once memory problems are addressed, there are more things to do with it, and it shifts more dynamically over long periods of time (improved war, disease, famine, migrations, etc).  For now you can control sprawl with the site cap, with the civilization number, with the savagery, and with the history end year from the ""Create World Now!"" menu without much fuss (and the default setting is much lighter on sprawl than the default in 0.31.13). Major bug fixes     (*)fixed problems with immigrants having strange unit types and erroneous announcements about terrifying forts     (*)allowed raw adamantine to be diggable now by adding a new tag to slade for the time being.  There is a side effect -- slade in old saves will be diggable.  Add [UNDIGGABLE] to slade in the save's raws in inorganic_stone_mineral.txt in your save to fix that.  If you choose to dig through the slade, please don't report any associated bugs.  The game likely won't be able to deal with it properly.

There are more than 1000 (!) levels to explore and the game comes along in several languages (english, german, french, russian, portugese, portugese, dutch, italian, swedish, hungarian, finnish and spanish). I'll let the developer explain what the game is about: Enigma is simple to learn, challenging to play and hard to master. It can be enjoyed by players of almost any age. It contains hundreds of levels. And if that weren't enough, it's also completely free. If you like puzzle games and have a steady hand, Enigma will probably keep you busy for hours on end. The object of the game is to find and uncover pairs of identically colored ""Oxyd"" stones. Simple? Yes. Easy? Certainly not! Hidden traps, vast mazes, laser beams, and, most of all, countless hairy puzzles usually block your direct way to the Oxyd stones. Enigma's game objects (and there are hundreds of them, lest you get bored) interact in many unexpected ways, and since many of them follow the laws of physics (Enigma's special laws of physics, that is), controlling them with the mouse isn't always trivial .... The original goal of the Enigma project was to keep the spirit of the Oxyd game series alive, after its publisher decided in 2002 to leave the gaming business. Fans of this famous game will have their déjà-vu. But over the years, Enigma has absorbed ideas from countless other popular games, and added its own unique twists to each of them. Not all of the levels have the same quality of course, but because of the sheer amount of levels, it doesn't really matter. If there are some you find frustrating (I think many of the laser levels are) just stop and try another one. Nice puzzle game with lots of different tasks and items to use. Be sure that it won't get repetitive for a very long time.",3647,,,"Archive BitTorrent,GZIP,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Mac OS X Disk Image,Metadata,PNG,Windows Executable",,Enigma_game,0.04,"index,nonoindex",45000350,,,software,,45,,,,"2015-01-26T10:53:36Z,2024-03-29T08:52:33Z",2015-01-26T10:53:36Z,,,,,,,"a href=""http://www.curlysworldoffreeware.com"" rel=""nofollow""","Windows games,Macintosh games,Linux games,Vintage computer games,Puzzle games",Enigma,,,9,2007

Mirrored from the Bay 12 Games website. Release notes for 0.31.04 (May 16, 2010): The main thing here is the new OpenGL code by Svein Ove Aas (Baughn).  Especially if you weren't running at maximum framerates even on the title screen, you should notice a great improvement.  There are some modes worth messing around with in data/init/init.txt -- try ""2D"" if the game does not work as well as it used to (or stick with the legacy version if truly necessary). You can get at macros with:     Ctrl+r = record     Ctrl+p = play     Ctrl+s = save     Ctrl+l = load There is a directory data/init/macros for them. You can use PNGs for (translucent) tilesets, you can resize the window using the border, you can zoom using the mouse wheel (reset with F10, you can rebind this to keys if you like) and multiple keys can be bound to one command. A lot of changes were necessary to get this running, so there are likely to be a variety of bugs.  The legacy version has also been reorganized to make releases easier, so there could be new bugs even there. Aside from that, we have some general fixes: Crash fixes     (*) stopped site finder from eating up a ton of memory (crashing the game on large maps) Major bug fixes     (*) changed day/night temperature calculations (fixes fish availability and melting in the rain)     (*) stopped suture and dressing jobs from being repeated over and over on healed wounds Minor changes     (*) made all vermin and smallish outdoor corpse items disappear over time (can be hit after a month for vermin, season for corpse chunks)     (*) changed ranges for adv mode temperature text     (*) made temperature of squares adjacent to lava slightly lower",48,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,ZIP",,DwarfFortress-0.31.04,0.04,"index,nonoindex",42588877,eng,,software,,1,,,,"2021-12-12T11:23:47Z,2022-02-15T16:46:15Z",2021-12-12T11:23:47Z,Bay 12 Games,,,Copyright (C) 2002-2010 by Tarn Adams,,,"a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"" rel=""nofollow"",table style=""border:1px solid #aaaaaa;padding:5px;background:#F4F4F4;"",tbody","Dwarf Fortress,Bay 12 Games,Tarn Adams,Toady One,Zach Adams,ThreeToe,simulation games,managemnt games,roguelike,mining,dwarves,Computer games,PC games,Windows games,Windows software,Linux games,Linux software,Mac games,Mac software,OS X",Dwarf Fortress v0.31.04,,,0,2010

I look again into the subculture surrounding free and open-source software, and I decided to archive Hedgewars . Another one of those games installed on my family computer when I was young (I remember playing version 0.9.11 as the first one I played and going up), it is ""a turn-based strategy, artillery, action and comedy game"" about, no, not about Sonic the Hedgehog (sorry), but arrays—I'm sorry, teams—of pink, high-pitched, earth-dwelling hedgehogs who exploit a wide array of weapons and tools and exploding each other, wreaking havoc across terrain in most of any familiar environment the mind can think of and leaving no enemy alive. With up to eight players commanding their hogs locally or online in a free-for-all or cooperative manner, it allows for a great level of customization, anything from hedgehog names, hats , and starting teams and hog counts to schemes involving game rules and weapons allowed and dropped in crates to drawing maps in the terrain editor, importing PNG files as playable maps, and even designing environments, called themes , including anything from textures, background music, and topographic features down to how the themes interact with the gameplay (e.g. some themes have snow and snow-like precipitation that pile up on the battlefield). In addition, one can also design maps and game modes with their own scripting , allowing for even wider possibilities of playing, all in ways that come across as more ambitious than Scorched Earth could possibly imagine . (The online documentation is impressive, too.) In case you have not caught it yet, this game is based on Team17's Worms , you know, about those psychopathic, dimwitted annelids that blast each other to earth dust. I must say, with the exception of Worms W.M.D (and possibly an upcoming board game , which makes sense in comparison to what Team17 has been putting out as of recent), those creatures really lost their figurative backbone after the release of Worms World Party , and I argue that, while it did not live up to Team17's standards of delivering a quality product with meaningful improvements, it did have redeeming qualities such as a mission editor , both for single-player and multiplayer; forts; and more (if still somewhat familiar) gameplay modifiers , although I would have preferred the last to be in the game options as settings that could almost entirely be toggled on, rather than limited to three slots in the slot machine-styled ""Wormpot"". It is unfortunate that Worms Armageddon has received, and continues to receive, a litany of updates and improvements , removing most (and perhaps eventually all ) of the incentive to buy it. It is curious then why Team17 bothered with a remaster . While the worms languish burrowed in the porous tunnels of corporate ineptitude, Hedgewars ' creators, lead developer Andrey ""unC0Rr"" Korotaev and Sergey Olontsev, sought a free software alternative to the hapless creatures, and with not much a better way to replace them than with another burrowing creature. I admit I still prefer the old Worms games up to year 2001 for their subversive ingenuity and an art style that better conveys comedic sense with juvenile, cartoonish graphics against surprisingly dark themes of carnage, all aided by hyperbole and non sequiturs . Hedgewars replicates its inspiration's successes on some marks, but could do better on others. That said, when the full version of the game was released nearly 13 years since the first stable version, it had been years since I last played the game, so it may be a little better than I remember. Still, I judge that Hedgewars is a viable alternative to an ebbing series since it is an open-source project where anyone can suggest and contribute an improvement and that still sees continual improvement, perhaps one day rivaling their annelid peers. I only considered uploading stable releases 0.8.1 to 0.9.2, as they all use a less expert art style. Version 0.9.3 was the version that overhauled the graphics, which then made its way into the full release. To obtain the source codes, I had to look at five GitHub commitments and four changesets on Mercurial , where the Hedgewars repository is stored. The latter was useful for searching the changes by tags, although one for version 0.9.0 was missing, despite it being released. Since there was also a tag for 0.8.0, I decided to upload that source code as a prerelease. All the uploads are solely Linux source codes, and no amount of use on the Wayback Machine could recover any compiled package. The only exception was 0.9.0 for Windows, but one antivirus vendor on VirusTotal—and such software is not always accurate for old Windows software—claims in the most ironic way imaginable that the application is a worm, and it is a good thing I ran the check beforehand, because I would have wasted hours on this upload. Lastly, I ran Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish in Oracle VirtualBox to perform a Linux-specific function. Since the Hedgewars files were distributed in the tar.bz2 file compression format, I performed commands in the terminal to utilize the bzip2 program. The aim of this upload was to reconstruct the source code and use a compression method to make the files compatible with legacy computers. I have not compiled any code, but most of the game folders contain an INSTALL file for instructions. Consider that you may need an old Linux machine or a legacy version of a supported Linux distro to run the compiled game.

I will let a couple of members describe it for you.. Usul wrote: Here we have a VERY nice racing game indeed. The controls are simple just as it should be, you don't need much time to get into the game. Good. Racing feeling is pure and great, the choice of cars is ok and they look quite accurate. The Career Mode is just cool, it's like a sort of Mini-Gran-Turismo with gains, upgrades and new cars. Only thing that annoyed me a little is that you have to repeat the first race numerous times in order to be competitive for the next ones... Thumbs up for this Chroelle wrote: The gameplay is good. I have put the game down and picked it back up around 9-10 times. I have played it every single day since P.A. suggested it. However it has some annoying sides, like Czech text lots of places, repetition of first race over and over to get upgrades and improvements, and when you are fully upgraded it seems you can only win the harder races, by getting pushed along by the faster cars behind you... Pater Alf wrote: Chroelle and Usul said everything: excellent racing game with 1 and two player, training and career mode. Gameplay is nice, I played it every single day for two weeks now and I'm not tired of it.

In it, you must maneuver a small vehicle around a world and collect powerups while avoiding obstacles, your opponents' trails, and even your own trail. There are five game modes available. Quest is the classical Nibbles, in Death Match you start with very long tails and must kill your opponents, in Kill'em All you must run over lemmings moving on the ground, in Time Cash or Color modes you must collect money or pyramids of color. Heroes features 12 original sound tracks, 94 levels (in 10 different tile sets) plus a level editor. Heroes' source code (distributed under the GNU General Public Licence version 2) originates from an original MS-DOS game but has been heavily modified to enhance the portability."" The project's original links are still active and online as of this upload. This is merely to provide a secondary backup for the files and also potentially get a few more eyes on its existence. This archive entry includes the latest Sourceforge Tarballs of the respective HEROES source code collections (e.g. SFX, music tracks, etc) as well as the latest Alpha v0.29c. It also includes my original ""install"" with the four main packages placed together with most of the settings and user saves reset to default. However, RUN.BAT has been slightly modified to run HEROES with parameters that allow clearer SFX and a larger resolution that even older systems will have no trouble with. The developers wrote an extremely thorough and verbose manual which has been included with the installation, one section being launch parameters for the game. A few of these include enabling debug functionality, changing the sound driver, and switching to one of five languages: English, French, Dutch, German, & Italian. The creators did not seem to have any sort of overarching organization or ""company"" name to be attributed to their works. Thus I have accredited two of the main creators by name, but I recommend viewing the credits section that includes the soundtrack producers, translators, packagers, and other contributors from within the manual itself. You can also listen to the game's jukebox to hear any of its music tracks from within the game's credits menu. The MS-DOS version has also been included, though can still be downloaded from its respective website below. It must be run as HEROES.EXE and cannot be renamed. While this DOS version runs standalone, upon exit it creates a few batch files that allows simpler execution for some launch parameters. The french.pox file can be dropped into the same folder that HEROES.EXE is in to automatically translate all menu text into French. This only applies to the DOS version. Linux builds can be fetched for your respective distros through the terminal or via its software center.  -- Original Sourceforge Project URL links -- Source Code revisions: https://sourceforge.net/projects/heroes Official website, manual, pre-compiled packages: http://heroes.sourceforge.net/index.html Obsoleted MS-DOS version (dev's words) : http://gadl.free.fr/heroes/heroes.html Linux package URLs for reference: https://packages.debian.org/unstable/games/heroes https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/heroes https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/heroes",142,,,"Archive BitTorrent,BZIP2,GZIP,Item Tile,JPEG,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,Unknown,ZIP",,heroes_source,0.02,"index,nonoindex,uncurated",19235811,"eng,French,German,Italian,Dutch",,software,,5,,,,"2022-04-30T05:17:52Z,2024-06-26T10:29:48Z",2022-04-30T05:17:52Z,,,,,,,,"Linux games,Windows games,freeware,action games,vintage computer games",Heroes 0.21 + Source Code,,,1,2002

This is not such an easy task, however. Many obstacles will be in your path, and it is up to you to determine the best (and sometimes only way) to get around them. Zep has the ability to create special ""blocks"" by using the life energy from the ground he is standing on. By building the blocks in specific patterns, Zep can alter the landscape to his ability thus allowing him to reach his goal! Again, not everything is as it seems. Zep cannot build blocks while standing of just anything. There are many types of ground that restrict Zep's building ability. In addition to being able to create these special blocks, Zep can also destroy them. Zep is trapped in a Dream Land where almost anything goes! As much as he wants to wake up, he cannot; unless he travels completely through it, visiting each different section he dreams up. What kind of special places does Zep hold dear? Traveling deeper and deeper into Zep's Dreamland reveals more and more obstacles as his imagination runs wild!

After uploading dozens of newsletter archives, I have decided to preserve a game called Quadra , version 1.3.0: 15th Anniversary Release. Quadra is the brainchild of Ludus Design , a Canadian company who developed and released it on May 25, 1999, which coincides with this upload on the game's 24th anniversary, only late by one day. It was uploaded to SourceForge as freeware, but, since version 1.1.4, its source code has been made public, and, much to the delight of the FOSS community, it comes with the GNU LGPL-2.1 license. As for the gameplay, Quadra is Ludus' take on Tetris . Now, let's say you were an Internet user in the 1990s who dowloaded and played free and libre games. You probably would have been exhausted by the sight of the volume of Tetris imitators and wannabes and understandably might have clicked past this game. Decide to check it out, however, and you would have realized it stands out from the rest of the pack. Quadra is a multiplayer-oriented game, allowing for TCP/IP and LAN connections, with team play mode allowed and single-player supported. It features decent visuals and backgrounds, a CD player, online chat, a worldwide high score system with personal bests logged, and cascade gravity, where tetrominoes fall independently of other blocks, allowing for possibilities of line clears well beyond four. The game is apparently fast, where seasoned players are reported to clear well over 200 blocks in a minute. Certainly, Quadro is better than your run-of-the-mill Tetris clone.

Using this wall you can capture and close off your opponent until there is no way for him except into your wall or his own. Game over - game won. Unfortunately there is only the lightcycle races in this game, in the original Tron there was also discus-throwing. Which was VERY cool. GLtron is made so more than one player can compete.

Release notes for 0.31.11 (July 23, 2010): Combat was the focus last time, and this time I moved over to equipment and training.  There are a number of bugs left to fix, but a lot of the largest problems should be cleaned up and training should be somewhat usable now.  I wanted to shift ammunition over to a default system where it doesn't get tied to particular squads/hunters (with the old way left as a default for people that want to control it more), since that remains one of the more annoying things, but I didn't have time to finish it up.  Just make sure you have some extra bolts sitting around, and 'm'-'f' should show you how your squads are doing ammo-wise.  Barracks should also probably default to a non-reserved/non-purposed system, though that's not as bad as ammunition reservation is.  In any case, I'll be moving on to the month-end project and entity populations, though I'll release again sooner if something comes up.

Release notes for 0.31.12 (July 25, 2010): Aside from the major bug fixes listed below, I made skill increases a little faster during training.  Part of the problem is with how classes work -- the teacher and student skills are important, and they can heavily amplify the effects, so the gains for people without those skills were small.  Now it'll be even more extreme that the base rate has increased, so we'll have to see how that plays out in forts that get good teachers.

It's great fun to play and you really have to use your brain to find the solution in some levels. Because of the different types of tiles you can find in later levels (like trampoline tiles or laser tile) the game always stays challenging and interesting and the game won't get boring for the whole 100 levels.

The idea behind ""Babala"" is to survive the enemies' oncoming attack on you. They move a specified set of spaces every turn and you have a similar set of moves to perform in your round to avoid them reaching you. That means avoiding, dodging, getting away and killing on the move. However it is turnbased so you won't be overcome by the pace, as you set it yourself - a good game with lots of different options, levels and many hours of addictive play. There is ammunition spread out on the level as pickups for you to reach and use. When you run out of ammo, your only hope is to lure them into traps and hope for the best. They will choose the shortest route towards you, so this one is a thinker where you have to use your environment to your advantage. Luckily they are unarmed, but still outnumber you, so if you keep them at arms length you should be ok, but watch your back, flanks and front! The one issue we have with ""Babala"" is the required installation of GIMP 2.0. Don't get us wrong - the consensus is that GIMP is a wonderful program with lots of features and it is free - but the hunt for files needed to play this game is tiresome but we do urge you to do it anyway, as you will end up with a great timewaster.",632,,,"Archive BitTorrent,Item Tile,JPEG Thumb,Metadata,PNG,Unknown,Windows Executable",,Babala_game,0,"index,nonoindex",907164,,,software,,2,,,,"2015-01-27T12:53:19Z,2024-03-27T14:26:06Z",2015-01-27T12:53:19Z,,,,,,,"a href=""http://www.curlysworldoffreeware.com"" rel=""nofollow""","Windows games,Linux games,Vintage computer games,Puzzle games",Babala,,,2,2004
